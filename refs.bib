  abstract = {With the burgeoning global demand for seafood, potential solutions like aquaculture are increasingly significant, provided they address issues like pollution and food security challenges in a sustainable manner. However, significant obstacles such as disease outbreaks and inaccurate biomass estimation underscore the need for optimized solutions. This paper proposes “Fish-Sense”, a deep learning-based pipeline inspired by the human visual system’s ability to recognize and classify objects, developed in conjunction with fish farms, aiming to enhance disease detection and biomass estimation in the aquaculture industry. Our automated framework is two-pronged: one module for biomass estimation using deep learning algorithms to segment fish, classify species, and estimate biomass; and another for disease symptom detection symptoms, employing deep learning algorithms to classify fish into healthy and unhealthy categories, and subsequently identifying symptoms and locations of bacterial infections if a fish is classified as unhealthy. To overcome data scarcity in this field, we have created four novel real-world datasets for fish segmentation, health classification, species classification, and fish part segmentation. Our biomass estimation algorithms demonstrated substantial accuracy across five species, and the health classification. These algorithms provide a foundation for the development of industrial software solutions to improve fish health monitoring in aquaculture farms. Our integrated pipeline facilitates the transition from research to real-world applications, potentially encouraging responsible aquaculture practices. Nevertheless, these advancements must be seen as part of a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving the aquaculture industry’s sustainability and efficiency, in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals’ evolving interpretations. The code, trained models, and the data for this project can be obtained from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Vision-At-SEECS/Fish-Sense.}

  abstract={Monitoring plankton populations in situ is fundamental to preserve the aquatic ecosystem. Plankton microorganisms are in fact susceptible of minor environmental perturbations, that can reflect into consequent morphological and dynamical modifications. Nowadays, the availability of advanced automatic or semi-automatic acquisition systems has been allowing the production of an increasingly large amount of plankton image data. The adoption of machine learning algorithms to classify such data may be affected by the significant cost of manual annotation, due to both the huge quantity of acquired data and the numerosity of plankton species. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient unsupervised learning pipeline to provide accurate classification of plankton microorganisms. We build a set of image descriptors exploiting a two-step procedure. First, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is trained on features extracted by a pre-trained neural network. We then use the learnt latent space as image descriptor for clustering. We compare our method with state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, where a set of pre-defined hand-crafted features is used for clustering of plankton images. The proposed pipeline outperforms the benchmark algorithms for all the plankton datasets included in our analysis, providing better image embedding properties.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic clocks are accurate tools for age prediction and are of great interest for fisheries management and conservation biology. Here, we review the necessary computational steps and tools in order to build an epigenetic clock in any species focusing on fish. Currently, a bisulfite conversion method which allows the distinction of methylated and unmethylated cytosines is the recommended method to be performed at single nucleotide resolution. Typically, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing methods provide enough coverage of CpGs to select from for age prediction while the exact implemented method depends on the specific objectives and cost of the study. Sequenced reads are controlled for their quality, aligned to either a reference or a deduced genome and methylation levels of CpGs are extracted. Methylation values are obtained in biological samples of fish that cover the widest age range possible. Using these datasets, machine learning statistical procedures and, in particular, penalized regressions, are applied in order to identify a set of CpGs the methylation of which in combination is enough to accurately predict age. Training and test datasets are used to build the optimal model or “epigenetic clock”, which can then be used to predict age in independent samples. Once a set of CpGs is robustly identified to predict age in a given species, DNA methylation in only a small number of CpGs is necessary, thus, sequencing efforts including data and money resources can be adjusted to interrogate a small number of CpGs in a high number of samples. Implementation of this molecular resource in routine evaluations of fish population structure is expected to increase in the years to come due to high accuracy, robustness and decreasing costs of sequencing. In the context of overexploited fish stocks, as well as endangered fish species, accurate age prediction with easy-to-use tools is much needed for improved fish populations management and conservation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial structuring of stocks is essential to study the dynamics of fish populations, and thus to manage fisheries. In this study, sagittal otolith shape was used to understand the stock structures of populations of the main commercial species caught around La Réunion Island. A total of 1091 individuals, belonging to nine species of bentho-pelagic bony fishes (Aphareus rutilans, Cephalopholis aurantia, Epinephelus fasciatus, Etelis carbunculus, Lutjanus kasmira, Lutjanus notatus, Pristipomoides argyrogrammicus, Pristipomoides filamentosus, Variola albimarginata), were analyzed and compared between 10 areas around La Réunion. To describe the external shape of the otolith, normalized Fourier elliptical descriptors were extracted. For each species, the analysis of shape data was performed in two steps. The first step was investigating the potential effects of confounding factors such as fish size, symmetry between right and left otoliths, sexual dimorphism and spatial distribution. When location showed a significant effect on otolith shape, a second step coupling two complementary analyses was performed with hierarchical clustering (unsupervised machine learning) and linear discriminant analysis with jackknifed prediction (supervised machine learning), allowing characterization of the potential stock limits for each of the treated species. The results show that, for the nine species treated, only two species (Etelis carbunculus and Pristipomoides filamentosus) show spatial structuring around Reunion Island with, for each of them, two stocks potentially separated along a northwest/southeast axis. These results show that some species around La Réunion Island may have local subpopulations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

When a computer program imitates a characteristic of the human brain that is considered 'innovator.' Among the methods are statistical methods, methods for artificial intelligence, and traditional order to verify the validity. The expansion of AI is also related to virtually infinite storage and an abundance of data, including exchanges, geospatial information, video files, photos, text messages, and audio files. Machine learning is divided into deep learning and deep learning is primarily divided into numerous layers of neural networks. This pattern gives it the ability to learn a lot of information and attempt to replicate the brain function. Increasing the efficiency by attaching more covert layers can be beneficial. It is used to gather the data and transfer the data. Aquaculture production has grown into a barrier to the growth of fish culture and the counting operation represents one of the problems experienced during the spawning process. Previous studies have primarily relied on the application of manual and automated counting techniques, which has prevented it from producing accurate results. The proposed method offers a promising method for enhancing image detection by combining the IoT techniques. The image data were divided into three categories: low frequency, intermediate density, as well as high frequency. The proposed method has used 8200 images to train and 2500 images for verification. Only the data relevant data sources were used during the train and verification phase in order to find the proper parameters and create a better VGG19 parameter calibration strategy.

Among the machine learning models tested, the ensemble model, which combines ridge and ridge CV, performs best, with metrics such as MAE of 0.02, MSE of 0.00, and R 2 of 1.00.

	abstract = {Oceans will play a crucial role in our efforts to combat the growing climate emergency. Researchers have proposed several strategies to harness greener energy through oceans and use oceans as carbon sinks. However, the risks these strategies might pose to the ocean and marine ecosystem are not well understood. It is imperative that we quickly develop a range of tools to monitor ocean processes and marine ecosystems alongside the technology to deploy these solutions on a large scale into the oceans. Large arrays of inexpensive cameras placed deep underwater coupled with machine learning pipelines to automatically detect, classify, count, and estimate fish populations have the potential to continuously monitor marine ecosystems and help study the impacts of these solutions on the ocean. In this paper, we successfully demonstrate the application of YOLOv4 and YOLOv7 deep learning models to classify and detect six species of fish in a dark artificially lit underwater video dataset captured 500Â m below the surface, with a mAP of 76.01% and 85.0%, respectively. We show that 2,000 images per species, for each of the six species of fish is sufficient to train a machine-learning species classification model for this low-light environment. This research is a first step toward systems to autonomously monitor fish deep underwater while causing as little disruption as possible. As such, we discuss the advances that will be needed to apply such systems on a large scale and propose several avenues of research toward this goal. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Machine learning (ML) is a potential solution but remains underutilized for marine monitoring, partly due to the time and cost of annotating new training datasets for each marine class and habitat. This raises the pivotal question: "How can we train marine machine learning models with limited annotated data?"We catalog publicly available marine datasets annotated for detection and classification, investigating the feasibility of leveraging a fish detector trained on three existing datasets to detect fish in a new small underwater marine dataset. We compare the accuracy and training time of pre-trained models to those without pre-training. We find pre-training with OzFish yields faster convergence and comparable performance with smaller training datasets. However, pre-training with some datasets reduced performance and increased training time. We expect our catalog of publicly available marine datasets will assist in the selection of pre-training datasets. Our results underscore the need for diverse, large, publicly available marine datasets with varied habitat and class distributions to develop and integrate ML models into automated systems for monitoring marine ecosystems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Visual characteristics are among the most important features for characterizing the phenotype of biological organisms. Color and geometric properties define population phenotype and allow assessing diversity and adaptation to environmental conditions. To analyze geometric properties classical morphometrics relies on biologically relevant landmarks which are manually assigned to digital images. Assigning landmarks is tedious and error prone. Predefined landmarks may in addition miss out on information which is not obvious to the human eye. The machine learning (ML) community has recently proposed new data analysis methods which by uncovering subtle features in images obtain excellent predictive accuracy. Scientific credibility demands however that results are interpretable and hence to mitigate the black-box nature of ML methods. To overcome the black-box nature of ML we apply complementary methods and investigate internal representations with saliency maps to reliably identify location specific characteristics in images of Nile tilapia populations. Analyzing fish images which were sampled from six Ethiopian lakes reveals that deep learning improves on a conventional morphometric analysis in predictive performance. A critical assessment of established saliency maps with a novel significance test reveals however that the improvement is aided by artifacts which have no biological interpretation. More interpretable results are obtained by a Bayesian approach which allows us to identify genuine Nile tilapia body features which differ in dependence of the animals habitat. We find that automatically inferred Nile tilapia body features corroborate and expand the results of a landmark based analysis that the anterior dorsum, the fish belly, the posterior dorsal region and the caudal fin show signs of adaptation to the fish habitat. We may thus conclude that Nile tilapia show habitat specific morphotypes and that a ML analysis allows inferring novel biological knowledge in a reproducible manner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture is an important industry in New Zealand (NZ). Mussel farmers often manually check the state of the buoys that are required to support the crop, which is labour-intensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide automatic and intelligent solutions to many problems but has seldom been applied to mussel farming. In this paper, a new AI-based approach is developed to automatically detect buoys from mussel farm images taken from a farm in the South Island of NZ. The overall approach consists of four steps, i.e. data collection and preprocessing, image segmentation, keypoint detection and feature extraction, and classification. A convolutional neural network (CNN) method is applied to perform image segmentation. A new genetic programming (GP) method with a new representation, a new function set and a new terminal set is developed to automatically evolve descriptors for extracting features from keypoints. The new approach is applied to seven subsets and one full dataset containing images of buoys over different backgrounds and compared to three baseline methods. The new approach achieves better performance than the compared methods. Further analysis of the parameters and the evolved solutions provides more insights into the performance of the new approach to buoy detection.}

	abstract = {Ocean observatories collect large volumes of video data, with some data archives now spanning well over a few decades, and bringing the challenges of analytical capacity beyond conventional processing tools. The analysis of such vast and complex datasets can only be achieved with appropriate machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. The implementation of AI monitoring programs for animal tracking and classification becomes necessary in the particular case of deep-sea cabled observatories, as those operated by Ocean Networks Canada (ONC), where Petabytes of data are now collected each and every year since their installation. Here, we present a machine-learning and computer vision automated pipeline to detect and count sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), a key commercially exploited species in the N-NE Pacific. We used 651 hours of video footage obtained from three long-term monitoring sites in the NEPTUNE cabled observatory, in Barkley Canyon, on the nearby slope, and at depths ranging from 420 to 985 m. Our proposed AI sablefish detection and classification pipeline was tested and validated for an initial 4.5 month period (Sep 18 2019-Jan 2 2020), and was a first step towards validation for future processing of the now decade-long video archives from Barkley Canyon. For the validation period, we trained a YOLO neural network on 2917 manually annotated frames containing sablefish images to obtain an automatic detector with a 92% Average Precision (AP) on 730 test images, and a 5-fold cross-validation AP of 93% (± 3.7%). We then ran the detector on all video material (i.e., 651 hours from a 4.5 month period), to automatically detect and annotate sablefish. We finally applied a tracking algorithm on detection results, to approximate counts of individual fishes moving on scene and obtain a time series of proxy sablefish abundance. Those proxy abundance estimates are among the first to be made using such a large volume of video data from deep-sea settings. We discuss our AI results for application on a decade-long video monitoring program, and particularly with potential for complementing fisheries management practices of a commercially important species. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Scientific acoustic-trawl surveys collect data that are used to track fish and zooplankton populations over time. Most rely on manual annotation during acoustic target classification, but automated methods have been proposed. Here, we report on a framework for testing deep learning-based acoustic classification models and integrating them into the survey estimation process. The approach was applied to North Sea lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) surveys from 2009 to 2024. Three U-Net-based models were tested: a baseline model, a depth-aware model, and a model trained with similarity-based sampling for the foreground class. A threshold based on the training years was applied to the models’ SoftMax outputs. The official sandeel estimation process was used as a starting point, replacing input data with model predictions. The biomass estimates were generally similar between manual annotations and model-based estimates, but variation existed across years. The baseline model misclassified a surface layer as sandeel and was prone to bottom contamination, causing larger deviations from official estimates. Discrepancies between the similarity-based model and the official estimates resulted from an incorrectly applied SoftMax threshold, leading to missing school interiors and indicating threshold sensitivity. Unlike traditional F1 score evaluations commonly used in image-based classification, our comparison assessed predictions in a survey-relevant context. The evaluation indicated that full automation was not yet feasible, but the predictions could be used as starting points for manual scrutiny. Annotating a subset of the data to refine thresholds or employing more advanced active learning approaches could enhance efficiency. These methods could enable faster, more consistent survey annotation.}

While these data are foundational to fishery research and management, the collection of length and weight data through physical handling of the fish is challenging as it is time consuming for personnel and can be stressful for the fish. Recent advances in imaging technology and machine learning now offer alternatives for capturing biometric data. To investigate the potential of deep convolutional neural networks to predict biometric data, several regressors were trained and evaluated on data stemming from the FishL™ Recognition System and manual measurements of length, girth, and weight. The dataset consisted of 694 fish from 22 different species common to Laurentian Great Lakes. Even with such a diverse dataset and variety of presentations by the fish, the regressors proved to be robust and achieved competitive mean percent errors in the range of 5.5 to 7.6% for length and girth on an evaluation dataset. Potential applications of this work could increase the efficiency and accuracy of routine survey work by fishery professionals and provide a means for longer-term automated collection of fish biometric data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Despite existing technologies, there remains a gap in smart feeding solutions tailored to the specific dietary requirements of different fish species and population sizes. This paper investigates smart fish feeding through automated detection, counting, classification and feeding of fishes within aquariums. As part of this paper, a smart population-driven aquarium maintenance system, named AquaTrack, is proposed that integrates Internet of Things (IoT), computer vision, machine learning, and sensor technologies. The system detects, classifies, and counts fish, adjusting feeding amounts based on species and population to mitigate the risks of overfeeding and underfeeding, which can significantly affect water quality. The system was evaluated through four research questions, where a general accuracy of 76.9% in fish species identification and 77.1% in fish counting were found. While promising outcomes were observed under specific conditions, variability and limitations in performance across different scenarios were also noted. Environmental factors such as lighting, reflections, shadows, and particulate matter affected the accuracies, particularly in scenarios involving smaller fish quantities. Based on these findings, the study recommends further refinement of the system to enhance its capabilities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Age estimates are traditionally obtained by human experts from the count of ring-like patterns along calcified structures such as otoliths. To automate the process and minimize human bias, modern methods have been designed utilizing the advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). While many AI-based methods have been shown to attain satisfactory accuracy, there are concerns regarding the lack of explainability of some early implementations. Consequently, new explainable AI-based approaches based on U-Net and Mask R-CNN have been recently published having direct compatibility with traditional ring counting procedures. Here we further extend this endeavor by creating an interactive website housing these explainable AI methods allowing age readers to be directly involved in the AI training and development.

	abstract = {Fishes of various trophic levels play an important role in the stability and balance of aquatic ecosystems. Metal contaminants can impair the survival and population fitness of fish at elevated concentrations. When universal water quality criteria (WQC) of metals are adopted to protect different species in different geographic regions, they may not adequately protect all fish due to a lack of consideration for site-specific environmental conditions and species assemblages. Additionally, obtaining credible toxicity data for rare and endangered species is challenging. Therefore, this study aims to develop a robust, machine learning-based method to predict the toxicity of metals to various fish species, including rare and endangered species, and combine it with the non-parametric kernel density estimation of the species sensitivity distribution (NPKDE-SSD) model to derive site-specific WQC for better ecosystem protection. We show that this machine learning-based approach, with consideration of physicochemical properties of metals, hydrochemical conditions, biological characteristics of fishes, and metal toxicities, as well as their relationships, can well predict the toxicity of 19 metals to various fish species. The method is applied to derive site-specific WQC (based on the hazardous concentration of 5%) of these metals for the Eastern Plain lake region in China. The study provides a novel, alternative approach to supplement the insufficient toxicity information for site-specific WQC derivation and potentially improve the protection of fish species. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) consist of the temporary gathering of a large number of fishes at a specific location to spawn. Monitoring of FSA is typically conducted by divers, but surveys are often restricted to a limited area and dependent upon sea conditions, thus our knowledge of FSA dynamics is extremely limited. Fisheries independent research strives for new technology that can help remotely and unobtrusively quantify fish biomass and abundance. Since some fish species, such as groupers, produce sounds during reproductive behaviors, Eulerian passive acoustic monitoring provides information when divers cannot access the FSA site. Fish sounds provide an innovative approach to assess fish presence and potentially their numbers during reproductive events. However, this technology is limited by the sound propagation range, hence the distance between the fish emitting sounds and the hydrophone location. As such, this Eulerian monitoring approach implicitly creates a knowledge gap about what happens beyond the range of the recorders. Furthermore, the large datasets make the detection process by human ears and eyes very tedious and inconsistent. This paper reports on two innovative approaches to overcome these limitations. To facilitate fish call detections, we have developed an algorithm based on machine learning and voice recognition methods to identify and classify the sounds known to be produced by certain species during FSA. This algorithm currently operates on a SV3 Liquid Robotics wave glider, an autonomous surface vehicle which has been fitted to accommodate a passive acoustic listening device and can cover large areas under a wide range of sea conditions. Fish sounds detections, classification results, and locations along with environmental data are transmitted in real-time enabling verification of the sites with high detections by divers or other in situ methods. Recent surveys in the US Virgin Islands with the SV3 Wave Glider are revealing for the first time the spatial and temporal distribution of fish calls surrounding known FSA sites. These findings are critical to understanding the dynamics of fish populations because calling fish were detected several kilometers away from the known FSAs. These courtship associated sounds from surrounding areas suggest that other FSAs may exist in the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In the last few years, the abundance of available plank-ton images has significantly increased due to advancements in acquisition system technology. Consequently, a growing interest in automatic plankton image classification has surged. Machine learning algorithms have recently emerged to assist in the analysis of this vast quantity of data, supporting traditional manual processing. However, annotating such data is costly and demands significant time and resources, thus requiring data-efficient machine learning solutions. The typical framework for tackling this issue has been the adoption of supervised ImageNet pre-trained models, and fine-tuning them on the plankton classification downstream task. Nonetheless, self-supervised pre-training protocols may provide an effective alternative to the supervised approaches using ImageNet, while allowing the exploitation of the increasingly large amount of unanno-tated plankton data. To the best of our knowledge, no work systematically analyzes the impact of self-supervised pre-training protocols for plankton image classification. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present a thorough comparison between in-domain (plankton images) and out-of-domain (ImageNet) supervised and self-supervised pre-training, in terms of the quality of the corresponding embeddings for plankton image classification. We believe that this work may pave the way for further research in self-supervised protocols for the plankton domain, providing a valuable alternative to ImageNet, and exploiting the vast amount of unannotated available plankton images.},

	abstract = {Efficacious monitoring of fish stocks is critical for efficient management. Multibeam acoustic cameras, that use sound-reflectance to generate moving pictures, provide an important alternative to traditional video-based methods that are inoperable in turbid waters. However, acoustic cameras, like standard video monitoring methods, produce large volumes of imagery from which it is time consuming and costly to extract data manually. Deep learning, a form of machine learning, can be used to automate the processing and analysis of acoustic data. We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and count fish in a publicly available dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) dataset. We compared three types of detections, direct acoustic, acoustic shadows, and a combination of direct and shadows. The deep learning model was highly reliable at detecting fish to obtain abundance data using acoustic data. Model accuracy for counts-per-image was improved by the inclusion of shadows (F1 scores, a measure of the model accuracy: direct 0.79, shadow 0.88, combined 0.90). Model accuracy for MaxN per video was high for all three types of detections (F1 scores: direct 0.90, shadow 0.90, combined 0.91). Our results demonstrate that CNNs are a powerful tool for automating underwater acoustic data analysis. Given this promise, we suggest broadening the scope of testing to include a wider range of fish shapes, sizes, and abundances, with a view to automating species (or ‘morphospecies’) identification and counts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the dense fish populations inherent in aquaculture systems exacerbate abiotic stressors and promote pathogenic spread, posing a risk to sustainability and yield. This study delves into the transformative potential of metagenomics, a method that directly retrieves genetic material from environmental samples, in elucidating microbial dynamics within aquaculture ecosystems. Our findings affirm that metagenomics, bolstered by tools in big data analytics, bioinformatics, and machine learning, can significantly enhance the precision of microbial assessment and pathogen detection. Furthermore, we explore quantum computing's emergent role, which promises unparalleled efficiency in data processing and model construction, poised to address the limitations of conventional computational techniques. Distinct from metabarcoding, metagenomics offers an expansive, unbiased profile of microbial biodiversity, revolutionizing our capacity to monitor, predict, and manage aquaculture systems with high accuracy and adaptability. Despite the challenges of computational demands and variability in data standardization, this study advocates for continued technological integration, thereby fostering resilient and sustainable aquaculture practices in a climate of escalating global food requirements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

For the first time, we formulated the problem into a multi-objective optimisation problem, including the design of the decision variables, objective functions and constraints. We also developed a simulator for the fish breeding process to facilitate research and analysis. Then, we applied the well-known NSGA-II to solve the MO-FBPD problem, analysed the performance of NSGA-II, and the distributions of the solutions obtained by the algorithm. The results shown are promising. First, it is observed that the breeding program, represented as the top percentage of the fish selected for mating, can generalise to different fish population size. In other words, the trained breeding programs can be applied to future breeding processes with any fish population size. Second, it is observed that the long-term and short-term gains of the fish population are conflicting with each other, and they follow a linear relationship. Finally, if the selection strength is too greedy, it may negatively affect even the short-term gain. This work is a promising preliminary study in this problem domain, which can pave the way for further research in MO-FBPD.}

In this regard, NIR spectroscopy has been used as an efficient tool for food authentication. This article reviews the latest research advances on NIR based fish authentication.

Sampling is an important aspect of traceability study and samples chosen ought to be a true representative of the population. NIR spectra acquired is often laden with overlapping bands, scattering and highly multicollinear. It needs adequate pre-processing to remove all undesirable features. The pre-processing technique can make or break a model and thus need a trial-and-error approach to find the best fit. As for spectral analysis and modelling, multicollinear nature of NIR spectra demands unsupervised analysis (PCA) to compact the features before application of supervised multivariate techniques such as LDA, PLS-DA, QDA etc. Machine learning approach of modelling has shown promising result in food authentication modelling and negates the need for unsupervised analysis before modelling. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) has quickly established itself as a powerful technique for the instant in situ analysis of foodstuffs. In the current study, a total of 1736 samples (2015–2021) - comprising 17 different commercially valuable fish species - were analysed using iKnife-REIMS, followed by classification with various multivariate and machine learning strategies. The results demonstrated that multivariate models, i.e. PCA-LDA and (O)PLS-DA, delivered accuracies from 92.5 to 100.0%, while RF and SVM-based classification generated accuracies from 88.7 to 96.3%. Real-time recognition on a separate test set of 432 samples (2022) generated correct speciation between 89.6 and 99.5% for the multivariate models, while the ML models underperformed (22.3–95.1%), in particular for the white fish species. As such, we propose a real-time validated modelling strategy using directly amenable PCA-LDA for rapid industry-proof large-scale fish speciation.}

	abstract = {Background: The growing global demand for seafood and the limitations of conventional aquaculture practices have highlighted the need for sustainable and efficient alternatives. Ocean-based fish farming faces challenges such as inconsistent water quality, delayed disease detection, and inefficient feeding strategies. Artificial Intelligence (AI), integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT), computer vision, and machine learning, offers opportunities to address these issues and advance smart aquaculture systems. Methods: This review systematically synthesizes literature, industrial reports, and case studies from leading aquaculture regions including Norway, Japan, India, and Chile. The analysis focuses on AI applications in water quality monitoring, fish health management, feeding optimization, biomass estimation, and decision support. The study also evaluates commercial platforms and identifies technical, economic, and ethical challenges, alongside emerging research directions. Results: AI-based monitoring and management systems demonstrated significant improvements in aquaculture practices. Commercial solutions such as eFishery, Aquabyte, and Aquaai reported feed cost reductions of 15–30%, early disease detection leading to up to 20% lower mortality rates, and more accurate biomass estimation exceeding 90% prediction accuracy. These outcomes resulted in enhanced yield, cost savings, operational efficiency, and compliance with environmental standards. Conclusion: AI technologies have shown transformative potential in achieving sustainable, climate-resilient aquaculture. While challenges such as data scarcity, high setup costs, environmental variability, and ethical concerns persist, emerging approaches—including multimodal AI, digital twins, robotics, and explainable AI—can enhance robustness and transparency.

	abstract = {The early stages of fish during their life cycle, including larvae and juveniles, are sensitive to the environment. Determining the occurrences of fish larvae and juvenile relative to their associated environments is essential for conservation and fisheries management. Computer-based modeling has rarely been applied for forecasting the distribution patterns of the early fish stages in dynamic systems such as estuaries. In the present study, we applied novel modeling techniques to fish larval and juvenile samples collected in May, September, November, and December during 2019 along the Ba Lat estuary of the Red River, northern Vietnam. The results showed that the occurrences of freshwater and marine fish larvae and juveniles were inversely related to environmental factors (electrical conductivity, temperature, pH, depth, shore distance and turbidity) with a high square of multiple correlation coefficients. The occurrences of the two fish groups were strongly related to temporal and spatial changes in the estuary, and these correlations could be utilized for machine learning processing. Linear regression, Gaussian process models, ensemble regression, and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to elucidate the distributions of fish larvae and juveniles. It shows that ANN models obtained the highest R<sup>2</sup> (> 0.63). In addition, the spatial distribution prediction of fish larvae and juveniles using ANN models was similar to the field measurement. Thus, we suggest utilizing ANN models to predict the occurrences of early fish stages in estuaries in tropical regions such as Vietnam. Recommendations for further applications of ANN models are also given in this study. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Deployments of underwater passive acoustic recorders have been widely used to study marine biodiversity, especially to detect vocal cetaceans. To process the huge amount of data collected, automatic detection and classification methods are necessary. Recently the development of such methods, which includes training and then testing the models, is mainly based on so-called ground-truth labels, obtained by manual annotation of audio files.However, manual annotation is a difficult and time-consuming process because of the large size of the datasets, the large diversity of the sounds, their unfamiliar representation, the variant quality of the acoustic recordings and the variability in human appreciation.These different factors induce non-negligible differences from one annotator to another, and better quantifying and understanding such differences is capital to make progress in machine learning applications.On this topic, the inter-annotator variability is investigated on three multi-annotator annotation campaigns performed on different marine bioacoustics datasets. Each of them gathered more than 10 annotators with different profiles, from novices to field experts, covering different annotation tasks, different geographical areas and varieties of sound classes. From this multi-annotation, this work enhances the understanding of the inter-annotator variability through the kappa-metrics. In a second part, from a grouping method of annotation based on a majority vote, a drastic reduction of the potential errors in the annotation from novice annotators is observed. This last observation enlightens the possibility of using citizen sciences to overcome the lack of annotation, while maintaining a quality of annotation expected by an expert.},

	abstract = {In this work a fish species distribution model (SDM) was developed, by merging species occurrence data with environmental layers, with the scope to produce high resolution habitability maps for the whole Mediterranean Sea. The final model is capable to predict the probability of occurrence of each fish species at any location in the Mediterranean Sea. Eight pelagic, commercial fish species were selected for this study namely Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, Sardinella aurita, Scomber colias, Scomber scombrus, Spicara smaris, Thunnus thynnus and Xiphias gladius. The SDM environmental predictors were obtained from the databases of Copernicus Marine Environmental Service (CMEMS) and the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). The probabilities of fish occurrence data in low resolution and with several gaps were obtained from Aquamaps (FAO Fishbase). Data pre-processing involved feature engineering to construct 6830 features, representing the distribution of several mean-monthly environmental variables, covering a time-span of 10 years. Feature selection with the ensemble Reciprocal Ranking method was used to rank the features according to their relative importance. This technique increased model’s performance by 34%. Ten machine learning algorithms were then applied and tested based on their overall performance per species. The XGBoost algorithm performed better and was used as the final model. Feature categories were explored, with neighbor-based, extreme values, monthly and surface ones contributing most to the model. Environmental variables like salinity, temperature, distance to coast, dissolved oxygen and nitrate were found the strongest ones in predicting the probability of occurrence for the above eight species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Concurrent with these advances, improved accessibility through machine learning software libraries has sparked investigations of applications across multiple domains. In the areas of fisheries research and management, efforts have centered on the localization of fish and classification by species, as such tools can estimate the health, size, and movement of fish populations. To aid in the interpretation of computer vision for fisheries research management tasks, a survey of the recent literature was conducted. In contrast to prior reviews, this survey focuses on employed evaluation metrics and datasets as well as the challenges associated with applying machine learning to a fisheries research and management context. Misalignment between applications and commonly used evaluation metrics and datasets mischaracterizes the efficacy of emerging computer vision techniques for fisheries research and management tasks. Aqueous, turbid, and variable lighted deployment settings further complicate the use of computer vision and generalizability of the reported results. Informed by these inherent challenges, culling surveillance data, exploratory data collection in remote settings, and selective passage and traps are presented as opportunities for future research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry that is increasingly recognized as a vital source of nutrition for the world's expanding population. Traditional fish farming is labor-intensive and non-technical, with unskilled workers and unorganized feed distribution resulting in high costs and environmental deterioration. To address these concerns, a solar-powered, automated fish-feeding boat has been designed and implemented in this study. This innovative system utilizes machine learning and a microcontroller-based control unit (i.e., a memory and input/output interface with I2C communication protocol) to deliver feed at a predetermined time at precise intervals in each day without human intervention, ensuring optimal fish nutrition and growth. The integration of solar power into the boat's operation exemplifies a commitment to environmentally sustainable practices by significantly reducing its carbon footprint. Furthermore, the automation of the fish-feeding process not only minimizes reliance on manual labor but also contributes to substantial cost savings, heightened operational precision, and improved overall efficiency.

  abstract = {Biofouling, the growth of organisms on submerged structures, poses significant challenges and costs for the aqua-culture industry. Implementing an image-driven approach to net cleaning, based on the actual biofouling growth rather than predetermined schedules or equipment availability, can offer substantial benefits. However, existing image analysis methods require manual processing, making the procedure highly time-consuming. This paper proposes an automatic process for analyzing biofouling images and quantifying net occlusion without human intervention. The study focuses on two types of bio-fouling images from king salmon farms in New Zealand, i.e., experimental net panels with blue backgrounds and GoPro video recordings of larger net sections. A novel image analysis method, incorporating adaptive thresholding and color discrimination, is proposed for processing images with blue backgrounds. For the GoPro images, we develop an automated analysis method to handle varying image quality. The proposed approaches can accurately detect net occlusion across two kinds of biofouling images, significantly improving the speed and effectiveness of biofouling assessments.}

However, fish image classification is challenging due to large intra-class variation and high inter-class similarity, especially when the quality of the images is low. To solve these challenges, a flexible region detection-based genetic programming approach with a new terminal set, FGPN, is proposed for fish classification tasks with low-quality images. The proposed approach FGPN could automatically choose suitable terminals, detect key regions, extract multiple types of feature, as well as combine global features and local features to address the classification tasks. Compared with seven benchmark methods, including two GP-based methods and five CNN-based methods, the proposed approach FGPN achieves significantly better performance in most comparisons on three real-world datasets.}

	abstract = {Species distribution models for marine organisms are increasingly used for a range of applications, including spatial planning, conservation, and fisheries management. These models have been constructed using a variety of mathematical forms and drawing on both physical and biological independent variables; however, what might be called first-generation models have mainly followed the form of linear models, or smoothing splines, informed by data collected in the context of fish surveys. The performance of different classes of variables were tested in a series of species occurrence models built with machine learning methods, specifically evaluating the potential contribution of lower trophic level data. Random forest models were fitted based on the classification of the absence/presence for fish and macroinvertebrates surveyed on the US Northeast Continental Shelf. The potential variables included physical, primary production, secondary production, and terrain variables. For accepted model fits, six variable importance measures were computed, which collectively showed that physical and secondary production variables make the greatest contribution across all models. In contrast, terrain variables made the least contribution to these models. Multivariable analyses that account for all performance measures reinforce the role of water depth and temperature in defining species presence and absence; however, chlorophyll concentration and some specific zooplankton taxa, such as Metridia lucens and Paracalanus parvus, also make important contributions with strong seasonal variations. Our results suggest that lower trophic level variables, if available, are valuable in the creation of species distribution models for marine organisms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The distribution of a group of fish and macroinvertebrates (n = 52) resident in the US Northeast Shelf large marine ecosystem were characterized with species distribution models (SDM), which in turn were used to estimate occurrence and biomass center of gravity (COG). The SDMs were fit using random forest machine learning and were informed with a range of physical and biological variables. The estimated probability of occurrence and biomass from the models provided the weightings to determine depth, distance to the coast, and along-shelf distance COG. The COGs of occupancy and biomass habitat tended to be separated by distances averaging 50 km, which approximates half of the minor axis of the subject ecosystem. During the study period (1978–2018), the biomass COG has tended to shift to further offshore positions whereas occupancy habitat has stayed at a regular spacing from the coastline. Both habitat types have shifted their along-shelf distances, indicating a general movement to higher latitude or to the Northeast for this ecosystem. However, biomass tended to occur at lower latitudes in the spring and higher latitude in the fall in a response to seasonal conditions. Distribution of habitat in relation to depth reveals a divergence in response with occupancy habitat shallowing over time and biomass habitat distributing in progressively deeper water. These results suggest that climate forced change in distribution will differentially affect occurrence and biomass of marine taxa, which will likely affect the organization of ecosystems and the manner in which human populations utilize marine resources. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This includes the progressive integration of information technology, data science and artificial intelligence with fishing and fish farming methods to enable intensification of aquaculture production, sustainable exploitation of natural fishery resources and mechanization-automation of allied activities. Exclusive data mining and machine learning systems are being developed to process complex datasets and perform intelligent tasks like analysing cause-effect associations, forecasting problems and providing smart-precision solutions for farming and catching fish. Considering the intensifying research and growing interest of stakeholders, in this review, we have consolidated basic information on the various practical applications of data mining and machine learning in aquaculture and fisheries domains from representative selection of scientific literature. This includes an overview of research and applications in (1) aquaculture activities such as monitoring and control of the production environment, optimization of feed use, fish biomass monitoring and disease prevention; (2) fisheries management aspects such as resource assessment, fishing, catch monitoring and regulation; (3) environment monitoring related to hydrology, primary production and aquatic pollution; (4) automation of fish processing and quality assurance systems; and (5) fish market intelligence, price forecasting and socioeconomics. While aquaculture has been relatively faster in integrating data mining and machine learning tools with advanced farming systems, capture fisheries is finding reliable methods to sort the complexities in data collection and processing. Finally, we have pointed out some of the challenges and future perspectives related to large-scale adoption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Interspecific interactions can play an essential role in shaping wildlife populations and communities. To date, assessments of interspecific interactions, and more specifically predator–prey dynamics, in aquatic systems over broad spatial and temporal scales (i.e., hundreds of kilometers and multiple years) are rare due to constraints on our abilities to measure effectively at those scales. We applied new methods to identify space-use overlap and potential predation risk to Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) and permit (Trachinotus falcatus) from two known predators, great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and bull (Carcharhinus leucas) sharks, over a 3-year period using acoustic telemetry in the coastal region of the Florida Keys (USA). By examining spatiotemporal overlap, as well as the timing and order of arrival at specific locations compared to random chance, we show that potential predation risk from great hammerhead and bull sharks to Atlantic tarpon and permit are heterogeneous across the Florida Keys. Additionally, we find that predator encounter rates with these game fishes are elevated at specific locations and times, including a prespawning aggregation site in the case of Atlantic tarpon. Further, using machine learning algorithms, we identify environmental variability in overlap between predators and their potential prey, including location, habitat, time of year, lunar cycle, depth, and water temperature. These predator–prey landscapes provide insights into fundamental ecosystem function and biological conservation, especially in the context of emerging fishery-related depredation issues in coastal marine ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

When these fish reach maturity, do they go to the water sources where their parents spawn, as do salmon? If Alburnus tarichi go to the same locations as their parents to spawn and hatch, then new strains of this species will start forming over time. This study applies two machine learning classification algorithms, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machine (SVM), to an original dataset for A. tarichi population analysis. Fish from nine areas were caught to prepare the original dataset. Five strains were found with machine learning classification algorithms in the Van Lake Basin, and results show that the accuracy levels of the k-NN algorithm were superior to those of the SVM algorithm in the population analysis of Alburnus tarichi. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In the context of transfer learning, our improved model FishDETECT uses the pre-trained FishMask model. Then it is tested in various complex scenes. The experimental results show that FishDETECT is more effective than a simple YOLO v5 model. Using the evaluation metrics Precision, Recall, and mAP50, our new model achieved accuracy rates of 0.962, 0.978, and 0.995, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

    Machine learning techniques play an important role in analyzing spectral data.

	abstract = {Fish species classification is crucial for understanding and preserving marine biodiversity. Advanced technologies such as computer vision and machine learning facilitate the identification and classification of different fish species based on their unique physical characteristics. Automatic fish classification systems are essential for biodiversity assessment, fisheries management, and environmental monitoring. This process involves collecting the image data of fish, extracting relevant features, and training machine learning models. Preprocessing the image data using Gaussian and median filters removes noise and enhances image quality. Mathematical morphological operations are employed for segmentation. For feature extraction, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and geometrical features are used. The GLCM extracts texture features, while geometrical features describe the shape and structure of the fish. Classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are then used to train the data, comparing it with the extracted features to achieve high accuracy in classification. This accurate classification is critical, especially considering the impact of environmental factors and fish species reduction on the balance of marine ecosystems. Changes in fish population can disrupt the ecological balance, highlighting the importance of effective monitoring and management systems to protect oceanic and sea environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of fish in their natural habitat plays a crucial role in anticipating changes within marine ecosystems. Marine scientists have a preference for automated, unrestricted underwater video-based sampling due to its non-invasive nature and its ability to yield desired outcomes more rapidly compared to manual sampling. Generally, research on automated video-based detection using computer vision and machine learning has been confined to controlled environments. Additionally, these solutions encounter difficulties when applied in real-world settings characterized by substantial environmental variability, including issues like poor visibility in unregulated underwater videos, challenges in capturing fish-related visual characteristics, and background interference. In response, we propose a hybrid solution that merges YOLOv11, a popular deep learning based static object detector, with a custom designed lightweight motion-based segmentation model. This approach allows us to simultaneously capture fish dynamics and suppress background interference. The proposed model i.e., DeepFins attains 90.0% F1 Score for fish detection on the OzFish dataset (collected by the Australian Institute of Marine Science). To the best of our knowledge, these results are the most accurate yet, showing about 11% increase over the closest competitor in fish detection tasks on this demanding benchmark OzFish dataset. Moreover, DeepFins achieves an F1 Score of 83.7% on the Fish4Knowledge LifeCLEF 2015 dataset, marking an approximate 4% improvement over the baseline YOLOv11. This positions the proposed model as a highly practical solution for tasks like automated fish sampling and estimating their relative abundance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Food processing companies pursue the distribution of ingredients that were packaged according to a certain weight. Particularly, foods like fish are highly demanded and supplied. However, despite the high quantity of fish to be supplied, most seafood processing companies have yet to install automation equipment. Such absence of automation equipment for seafood processing incurs a considerable cost regarding labor force, economy, and time. Moreover, workers responsible for fish processing are exposed to risks because fish processing tasks require the use of dangerous tools, such as power saws or knives. To solve these problems observed in the fish processing field, this study proposed a fish cutting point prediction method based on AI machine vision and target weight. The proposed method performs three-dimensional (3D) modeling of a fish’s form based on image processing techniques and partitioned random sample consensus (RANSAC) and extracts 3D feature information. Then, it generates a neural network model for predicting fish cutting points according to the target weight by performing machine learning of the extracted 3D feature information and measured weight information. This study allows for the direct cutting of fish based on cutting points predicted by the proposed method. Subsequently, we compared the measured weight of the cut pieces with the target weight. The comparison result verified that the proposed method showed a mean error rate of approximately 3%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In isolated or unmanned lake scenarios, where traditional monitoring systems often break down, fishery theft is a major threat to the aquaculture industry. Through the application of machine learning techniques for smart monitoring and anomaly detection, this study suggests an innovative approach to safeguarding fisheries lakes from theft. The proposed solution employs trained machine learning models to classify suspicious activity, identify illegal intrusions, and patrol lake borders by integrating computer vision with real-time sensor input. A variety of classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were tried and tested for accuracy and reliability in detecting boat and human movement using a specially designed dataset derived from surveillance footage. Under different illumination and weather conditions, the system demonstrated more than 92% accuracy in recognizing potential theft situations. The experiments demonstrate that machine learning offers an economical and scalable method for enhancing security in off-grid fishing environments when integrated with low-cost hardware and Internet of Things infrastructure. Model deployment by utilizing edge-based models and connectivity with automatic alarm systems for instantaneous action are just a few instances of the present future work.},

However, traditional machine learning algorithms are incapable of recognizing images with complex backgrounds and various illuminations. These fish algorithms are based on factors of color, texture, and feature extraction, which results in low recognition accuracy or inferior robustness. This paper aims to improve the fish recognition algorithm based on AlexNet by using the following methods: Firstly, item-based soft attention mechanism is utilized to facilitate accuracy. Secondly, the proposed model has less structural complexity, as it only consists of four convolutional layers, one item-based soft attention layer, and two fully-connected layers. Transfer learning is implemented to achieve a shorter training time. The experimental results show that our proposed model achieves higher accuracy and less computational complexity compared to many state-of-the-art fish recognition algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Using automated imaging technologies, it is now possible to generate previously unprecedented volumes of plankton image data which can be used to study the composition of plankton assemblages. However, the current need to manually classify individual images introduces a bottleneck into processing chains. Although Machine Learning techniques have been used to try and address this issue, past efforts have suffered from accuracy limitations, especially in minority classes. Here we use state-of-the-art methods in Deep Learning to investigate suitable architectures for training an automated plankton classification system which achieves high efficacy for both abundant and rare taxa. We collected live plankton from Station L4 in the Western English Channel and imaged 11,371 particles covering 104 taxonomic groups using the automated plankton imaging system FlowCam. The image set contained a severe class imbalance, with some taxa represented by > 600 images while other, rarer taxa were represented by just 14. We demonstrate that by allowing multiple Deep Learning models to collaborate in a single classification system, classification accuracy improves for minority classes when compared with the best individual model. The top collaborative model achieved a 6 % improvement in F1 accuracy over the best individual model, while overall accuracy improved by 3.2 %. This resulted in a 97.4 % overall accuracy score and a 96.2 % F1 macro score on a separate holdout test set containing 104 taxonomic groups. Based on a survey of similar studies in the literature, we believe collaborative deep learning models can significantly improve the accuracy of existing automated plankton classification systems.},

	abstract = {In the era of the blue bio-economy, which promotes the sustainable utilization and exploitation of marine resources for economic growth and development, the fisheries and aquaculture industries still face huge sustainability issues. One of the major challenges of these industries is associated with the generation and management of wastes, which pose a serious threat to human health and the environment if not properly treated. In the best-case scenario, fishery and aquaculture waste is processed into low-value commodities such as fishmeal and fish oil. However, this renewable organic biomass contains a number of highly valuable bioproducts, including enzymes, bioactive peptides, as well as functional proteins and polysaccharides. Marine-derived enzymes are known to have unique physical, chemical and catalytic characteristics and are reported to be superior to those from plant and animal origins. Moreover, it has been established that enzymes from marine species possess cold-adapted properties, which makes them interesting from technological, economic and sustainability points of view. Therefore, this review centers around enzymes from fishery and aquaculture waste, with a special focus on proteases, lipases, carbohydrases, chitinases and transglutaminases. Additionally, the use of fishery and aquaculture waste as a substrate for the production of industrially relevant microbial enzymes is discussed. The application of emerging technologies (i.e., artificial intelligence and machine learning) in microbial enzyme production is also presented. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We developed a wavelet-based framework using fk14 synthesis and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to reconstruct brown croaker vocalizations. Parameter sensitivity analysis identified delay and scale as key factors, enabling >98% waveform similarity in marine bioacoustic reconstruction. A ResNet-18-based Siamese network validated near-unity similarity (~0.9996) and evaluated across varying SNR conditions. This method enables high-fidelity bioacoustic signal synthesis for passive monitoring and machine learning data augmentation. Highlights: Fish species’ biological vocalizations serve as essential acoustic signatures for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and ecological assessments. However, limited availability of high-quality acoustic recordings, particularly for region-specific species like the brown croaker (Miichthys miiuy), hampers data-driven bioacoustic methodology development. In this study, we present a framework for reconstructing brown croaker vocalizations by integrating fk14 wavelet synthesis, PSO-based parameter optimization (with an objective combining correlation and normalized MSE), and deep learning-based validation. Sensitivity analysis using a normalized Bartlett processor identified delay and scale (length) as the most critical parameters, defining valid ranges that maintained waveform similarity above 98%. The reconstructed signals matched measured calls in both time and frequency domains, replicating single-pulse morphology, inter-pulse interval (IPI) distributions, and energy spectral density. Validation with a ResNet-18-based Siamese network produced near-unity cosine similarity (~0.9996) between measured and reconstructed signals. Statistical analyses (95% confidence intervals; residual errors) confirmed faithful preservation of SPL values and minor, biologically plausible IPI variations. Under noisy conditions, similarity decreased as SNR dropped, indicating that environmental noise affects reconstruction fidelity. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework can reliably generate acoustically realistic and morphologically consistent fish vocalizations, even under data-limited scenarios. The methodology holds promise for dataset augmentation, PAM applications, and species-specific call simulation. Future work will extend this framework by using reconstructed signals to train generative models (e.g., GANs, WaveNet), enabling scalable synthesis and supporting real-time adaptive modeling in field monitoring. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The European hake (Merluccius merluccius) is a highly sought after, overfished commercial species with a high ecological value. Otolith morphometric characteristics were employed from 150 individuals captured from the Central Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean) using a commercial trawler. Age reading was independently performed by three readers. A multivariate methodology identified the morphometric factors that significantly affect age estimation, and easy to use equations using limited morphological otolith characteristics with a high degree of accuracy were produced as a practical tool for fisheries management. A second tool using ML algorithms produced a highly accurate ML model with the ability to further predict European hake’s age using limited otolith morphometric characteristics. Both tools are important for assessing fish population dynamics, managing sustainable fishing practices, and ensuring the long-term health of marine ecosystems. Practically, the models could be implemented by collecting fish otolith samples, measuring limited morphometric features using imaging techniques, and inputting these measurements into the machine learning model. Both model outputs will allow researchers and fisheries managers to obtain rapid and reliable age estimates without the need for labor-intensive traditional methods. By integrating these models into routine fisheries assessment workflows, stakeholders could make more informed decisions about fish stock assessments and conservation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Gizzard shads are facing a continual decline in population, necessitating the implementation of selective gear design for effective resource management. This study aims to prevent the bycatch of young gizzard shads, a non-target fish species, and to derive mesh sizes appropriate for fishery management. Experimental fishing (n = 11) was conducted by manufacturing gillnet fishing gear with different mesh sizes (50.5, 55.1, 60.6, and 67.3 mm) in the coastal waters of the southern Gyeongsang Province. Two methods were employed to estimate the appropriate mesh size of the shad gillnet as follows: firstly, by analyzing the selectivity curve based on body length data; secondly, by developing a complex machine learning model considering biological and economic factors. Model 1 was constructed using mesh variables to classify the score groups. As a result of this study, the total length with a 0.5 gillnet selection ratio. which was estimated to be 179.3, 195.6, 215.1, and 238.9 mm for the 50.5, 55.1, 60.6, and 67.3 mm mesh sizes, respectively. In Model 1, a mesh size of 57.85 mm or less was determined as the most appropriate mesh size. Therefore, considering both biological and economic aspects, shad gillnets should have a mesh size in the 50.5 to 55.1 mm range. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is a challenging task for towed array sonars in the presence of self-noise. Hence, self-noise cancellation (SNC) is necessary for correct detection and DOA estimation of the targets. Deep learning techniques, with their high-feature extraction capability and self-learning ability have been used for de-noising in image and audio processing, but have not been attempted in the underwater acoustics for SNC. We have therefore proposed SNC using autoencoders and VGG-16 based encoder-decoder (VGG-ED), trained in both supervised and semi-supervised manner. With the knowledge of the clean signal (without self-noise) and actual target DOAs, the autoencoder learns in a supervised manner to estimate the clean signal from the noisy signal. Since the clean signal is unavailable in reality, we also propose to use a semi-supervised learning approach. Herein, the autoencoder is trained with the estimated clean signal produced by the null space projection technique using self-noise and corresponding signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR). The proposed autoencoder can reduce self-noise by 51 dB when SINR is −32 dB with a fewer sensors and snapshots.},

  abstract={This letter presents novel methodologies employing deep neural networks to address the problem of self-noise cancellation in passive SONAR systems. In this method, an autoencoder enables a transformation on the diagonal matrix to remove the orthogonal vectors that correspond to self-noise. The method centers on an eigencomponent transformation (ET) approach, creating a mapping between a diagonal matrix containing noisy data and an updated diagonal matrix obtained from the original target data. The ET approach converges faster compared to a direct approach, which maps noisy data to clean data. To cater to the difficulty of obtaining the original target data in real-world scenarios, we have also proposed a semisupervised version of this ET approach. In this technique, the diagonal matrix of the estimated target signal is computed using singular value decomposition (SVD). Our research makes predictions under two distinct conditions: matched and mismatched. In the matched conditions, both the training and test data exhibit similar ambient noise characteristics. In contrast, the mismatched conditions refer to instances where the ambient noise characteristics of the training and test data differ. Experimental results are portrayed in the form of a beampattern plot, waterfall display, and output signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) versus input SINR.},

	abstract = {Measuring and monitoring fish welfare in aquaculture research relies on the use of outcome- (biotic) and input-based (e.g., abiotic) welfare indicators (WIs). Incorporating behavioural auditing into this toolbox can sometimes be challenging because sourcing quantitative data is often labour intensive and it can be a time-consuming process. Digitalization of this process via the use of computer vision and artificial intelligence can help automate and streamline the procedure, help gather continuous quantitative data and help process optimisation and assist in decision-making. The tool introduced in this study (1) adapts the DeepLabCut framework, based on computer vision and machine learning, to obtain pose estimation of Atlantic salmon parr under replicated experimental conditions, (2) quantifies the spatial distribution of the fish through a toolbox of metrics inspired by the ecological concepts home range and core area, and (3) applies it to inspect behavioural variability in and around feeding. This proof of concept study demonstrates the potential of our methodology for automating the analysis of fish behaviour in relation to home range and core area, including fish detection, spatial distribution and the variations within and between tanks. The impact of feeding on these patterns is also briefly outlined, using 5 days of experimental data as a demonstrative case study. This approach can provide stakeholders with valuable information on how the fish use their rearing environment in small-scale experimental settings and can be used for the further development of technologies for measuring and monitoring the behaviour of fish in research settings in future studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In fisheries management, accurate estimates of fish stock abundances are crucial for sustainable harvesting practices. Traditional methods often rely on catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data, assuming fishing effort is uniformly distributed across the stock range. However, this assumption is often violated, leading to potential biases in CPUE-based abundance indices (AI). In the present study, we focused on chub mackerel stock in the East Asian Marginal Seas (EAMS), where shifting fishing grounds and ocean warming have raised concerns regarding the reliability of the nominal CPUE trend. We developed a spatiotemporal machine learning approach to predict the CPUE values while taking into consideration environmental variables and changes in fish distribution. Our model accounts for unexploited areas, thereby addressing the sampling biases inherent to traditional CPUE analyses. The results suggest that recent declines in the nominal CPUE observed in Japan do not reflect the actual stock declines but instead reflect biases due to shrinking fishing areas. These findings highlight the need for more sophisticated methods in fisheries management to ensure sustainable practices and highlight the importance of considering environmental and distributional changes in fish stock assessments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is a crucial tool for understanding the spatial dynamics of algal blooms by quantifying and detecting algal proliferation in water bodies. Hyperspectral remote monitoring enables precise pigment concentration measurements of Cyanobacteria, facilitating the accurate quantification of algal blooms with high spatial and spectral resolutions. However, current water quality management policies in the Republic of Korea predominantly rely on phytoplankton concentration to assess algal bloom status, which presents challenges for effective pigment estimation from remote sensing. To address this gap, this study employed airborne remote sensing using hyperspectral imagery and a deep-learning approach to directly estimate phytoplankton cell concentrations across extensive water bodies. Airborne monitoring was conducted to comprehensively capture the spatiotemporal features of algal dynamics from 2016 to 2022, complemented by concurrent in situ assessments of phytoplankton concentration, including Cyanobacteria, diatom, and Green algae. Utilizing a Bayesian neural network and natural gradient-boosting algorithm, we simulated phytoplankton abundance using airborne remote sensing data. The probabilistic models achieved test accuracy with coefficients of determination (R2) of approximately 0.6 and 0.4 for the cell concentration of different algal phyla, respectively. Furthermore, the algorithms provided spatial distributions of algal cell concentrations, enabling the identification of critical management zones for water quality. This study demonstrates that probabilistic deep learning algorithms can deliver timely and accurate phytoplankton concentrations, improving decision-making processes in water quality management.}

Therefore, instead of using a single machine learning model to address the price fluctuations, we propose a hybrid fish price prediction model integrating multiple machine learning and deep learning models to identify and predict fish price dynamics in various wholesale markets. The extensive experimental results on actual market data from the Taiwan Council of Agriculture (COA) show that the proposed models can achieve >90% accuracy in predicting future aquatic prices.

As part of the harvesting process, some commercial fishers accidentally bycatch seabirds during fishing operations, which can result in accidental deaths and injuries. The accidental bycatch is impacting the long-term sustainability of New Zealand seabird populations. To address this, we developed a YOLO model that can be used to automatically detect seabirds that interact with the fishing vessels. The model development process involved gathering, annotating and preprocessing a new image dataset, conducting transfer learning across YOLO benchmark models, and performing hyperparameter tuning on the top YOLO models to further improve the model's performance. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our developed model under diverse data conditions, with it achieving a mAP@50 score of 0.9926 and a mAP@50-95 score of 0.9147 on the test data. The results demonstrate that the developed model performs effectively in unconstrained real-world marine scenarios, addressing the limitations of previous models primarily evaluated in controlled settings. This automation could help to reduce or even eliminate manual inspection of footages by reviewers and will help to quantify seabird interactions with commercial fishing vessels. Our contributions represent a significant first step in automated seabird detection, mitigating the gap between constrained and unconstrained real-world maritime scenarios.}

	abstract = {Poyang Lake is not only a globally important stopover for migratory birds and a habitat for fish, but also one of the main sand mining areas in China. However, sand mining activities significantly affect the suspended sediment concentration in Poyang Lake, thereby impacting water quality, altering lake bed topography, and potentially disturbing the living environment of plants and animals. Therefore, understanding the suspended sediment concentration and the spatiotemporal patterns of sand mining activities in Poyang Lake holds vital significance for effective lake management and biodiversity conservation. Utilizing surface reflectance (SR) data derived from Landsat satellite imagery sourced via Google Earth Engine spanning from 1989 to 2018, coupled with SSC data recorded by daily observation at Hukou hydrological stations, we conducted a comparative analysis of five distinct methods: Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). Moreover, the applicability of machine learning methods was analyzed and compared across four scenarios (#01 Landsat 5, #02 Landsat 7, #03 Landsat 8, and #04, Landsat 5, 7, and 8). Using the optimal SSC estimation model, we investigated the spatial and temporal trends of sand mining activities in Poyang Lake from 1989 to 2021, along with their potential impact on suspended sediment levels in the water body. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of machine learning is better than that of linear regression models, and the RF model has the best performance. The RF model generated R2 > 0.9 for four scenarios (#01 Landsat 5, #02 Landsat 7, #03 Landsat 8, and #04 Landsat 5, 7, and 8) and showed little to no overfitting. The generated SSC map can clearly show the distribution of SSC in Poyang Lake, unveiling the impact of sand mining activities on suspended sediment, especially around sand dredgers where SSC can exceed 0.15 g/L. Sand mining activities in Poyang Lake emerged after 2000 and gradually shifted southward and expanded, reaching a peak in 2016. Fortunately, under government regulation, illegal sand mining has been effectively controlled and is currently concentrated near Songmenshan Island. Despite the fact that sand mining has been brought under control, there remains a necessity for heightened oversight to prevent any impact on national nature reserves. The Random Forest (RF) model demonstrates significant potential in utilizing Landsat satellite data to predict SSC in Poyang Lake, as well as to monitor sand mining activities in the area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While previous studies have focused on various techniques such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision, the resulting feed delivery has been uncontrollable, leading to compromised water turbidity and fish health. This study addresses these challenges by utilizing a computer vision method to accurately detect and count pellets, which can be applied to pellet distribution. The model incorporates three pre-processing methods, including Gaussian blur, HSV, and masking, which have shown significant effects on the detection and counting process. Gaussian blur reduced the detected pellet to 445, a 2776 reduction employing HSV conversion and a 3140-pellet detection incorporating the pellet color using mask in the process. Consequently, the implementation of these techniques has resulted in a substantial reduction ultimately leading to a more precise outcome that can be employed to regulate the feed quantity. This performance in detecting and counting pellets makes the model suitable for automated pellet distribution in fish feeding management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Plankton monitoring plays an essential role in marine ecological environment protection, effective identification of its species and quantity can assess the health of the marine ecosystem. Thus, it is valuable to build an automatic classification system for plankton. However, the data of plankton naturally exhibit an imbalance in their class distribution. As a result, we need to take the class-imbalance problem into account for plankton classification. In this paper, we propose a classification model based on a hybrid resample method with LightBGM classifier. Our hybrid resample method combines borderline-SMOTE oversampling and Fuzzy C-means cluster-based undersampling (BSFCM), which is available for handling both within-class and between-class imbalance. In addition, to eliminate the irrelevant factors, dataset preprocessing and feature dimension reduction are employed for the in situ plankton images.

	abstract = {Understanding the spatial distribution of organism abundance is fundamental to assessing and managing ecological populations. Marine species can be difficult and logistically challenging and expensive to observe. This often results in spatial data containing low detection rates when sampling underwater, biasing spatial predictions from many modeling approaches. We propose a multistage statistical workflow that can use zero inflated sampling data to develop non-linear predictive spatial distributions of reef fish abundance. The workflow includes: (1) an individual-based discrete event simulation which generates simulated survey data under different abundance settings; (2) empirical maximum likelihood analysis to establish the relationship between survey data and abundance from the simulation; (3) a two-step random smoothing method to estimate reliable block spatial abundance around each survey station; (4) an ensemble of different machine learning models which use the estimated abundance from step three as input to compute a stable non-linear prediction of abundance across the entire study area (Gulf of Mexico). Applying our workflow greatly improved the ability to forecast abundance at small spatial scales. The ability to forecast at fine spatial scales is critical when working with species that are patchily distributed. This workflow can apply to many ecological populations to develop abundance maps even if sample data is not well distributed across the study area or is zero inflated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Being inherently limited by the wave properties of light, underwater plankton cameras compromise between their imaging resolution and field of view (FOV) for in situ observations. In order to enlarge the sampling volume in single frame acquisition, lower magnifications are usually adopted to enable larger FOV but sacrifice the resolution. In this paper, we build a real-underwater image dataset called IsPlanktonSR for in situ plankton im-age super-resolution (SR), in which paired low resolution (LR) and high resolution (HR) images of the same individual live planktonic organisms are captured by a customized dual-channel darkfield imaging system. An image registration algorithmic pipeline is also proposed to preprocess and align the image pairs at different scaling factors of 2× and 4×. The IsPlanktonSR dataset is used to train an enhanced deep residual network for SR through the L2, the perceptual and the contextual losses, respectively. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the deep learning model trained on real data through the contextual loss has de-livered better visual and quantitative SR performance than those trained on simulated data or through other loss functions. The trained SR model is also proved to generalize well to images of various plankton species or captured by different instruments. The proposed SR technology is anticipated to enhance the existing darkfield plankton imageries and enable the future in situ plankton imaging instruments for better observation capability and hence deepen under-standing of the plankton ecology.},

	abstract = {Food remains a major source of human exposure to chemical contaminants that are unintentionally present in commodities globally, despite strict regulation. Scientific literature is a valuable source of quantification data on those contaminants in various foods, but manually summarizing the information is not practicable. In this review, literature mining and machine learning techniques were applied in 72 foods to obtain relevant information on 96 contaminants, including heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, furans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, mycotoxins, and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs). The 11,723 data points collected from 254 papers from the last two decades were then used to identify the patterns of contaminants distribution. Considering contaminant categories, metals were the most studied globally, followed by PAHs, mycotoxins, pesticides, and HAAs. As for geographical region, the distribution was uneven, with Europe and Asia having the highest number of studies, followed by North and South America, Africa and Oceania. Regarding food groups, all contained metals, while PAHs were found in seven out of 12 groups. Mycotoxins were found in six groups, and pesticides in almost all except meat, eggs, and vegetable oils. HAAs appeared in only three food groups, with fish and seafood reporting the highest levels. The median concentrations of contaminants varied across food groups, with citrinin having the highest median value. The information gathered is highly relevant to explore, establish connections, and identify patterns between diverse datasets, aiming at a comprehensive view of food contamination. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Automated camera-based sensors are widely used in vessel-based research to monitor plankton and marine particles. However, current methods suffer from the costly and time-consuming requirement of annotating data for fully supervised learning, especially in plankton grouping tasks characterized by long-tailed datasets. In response, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that significantly reduces reliance on expensive human annotations by leveraging crucial metadata such as water depth and location. The method comprises three major steps: self-supervised training, innovative sampling, and final classification. It identifies key sample subsets from an unlabeled dataset using a hierarchical clustering approach and incorporates an innovative balancing representative subsampling strategy that addresses the challenge of dataset imbalance and enhances generalizability across diverse plankton classes. Our approach prioritizes discerning representation features observed in images that exhibit correlations with the patterns found in their associated metadata. Furthermore, our method introduces a novel grouping based on the visual perspective selection method, enabling the identification of balanced subset views that depart from traditional class-based categorization. Our experimental results showcase a significant enhancement in image classification accuracy, with a 23% improvement over methods that do not utilize metadata, and attains a macro F1-score of 54% for ten populated species from a severely long-tailed dataset. This is achieved with a mere 0.3% of the entire dataset used for annotation.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture has emerged as a critical component in satisfying the world's increasing demand for high-quality protein while relieving strain on wild fish populations. Oreochromis niloticus, also known as Nile tilapia, is one of the most economically important aquaculture species. Optimizing manufacturing efficiency and limiting resource waste, on the other hand, remains a difficulty. The construction of an Intelligent Recirculating Aquaculture System (IRAS) powered by a Feed-Conversion-Ratio (FCR)-based Machine Learning (ML) framework is used in this study to improve the sustainability and productivity of Oreochromis niloticus aquaculture. To establish a closed-loop aquaculture environment, the IRAS incorporates advanced sensor technologies, real-time data monitoring, and control systems. The use of machine learning algorithms trained on historical and real-time FCR data to anticipate and improve the feeding regime for Nile tilapia is central to this approach. The ML model modifies feeding schedules and quantities to enhance growth while decreasing feed waste and the associated environmental effects by continuously learning from FCR patterns. Furthermore, this study shows the feasibility and usefulness of the FCR-based ML strategy in enhancing feed utilization efficiency, growth rates, and overall performance of Oreochromis niloticus in an IRAS through a series of studies. The results show a significant reduction in feed waste and expenses, resulting in improved economic viability and environmental sustainability of the aquaculture system. Furthermore, the ML-driven system adapts to changing environmental conditions and improves the fish population's general health and well-being.. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) typically rely on underwater sound to communicate with sound channel physics defining communication performance. Current acoustic propagation models incorporate channel information and physics but are computationally expensive to run onboard an AUV. This work explores reduced-order proxies for these models through a machine-learning approach that can use in-situ measurements of observed sound-speed profile (SSP) to quickly provide transmission loss (TL) propagation information for vehicles to optimize communication performance through repositioning behaviors. The vertical structure from a year-long time series of mooring observations from offshore San Diego is decomposed with empirical orthogonal functions to reduce the SSPs to three unique amplitudes that explain 95.6% of the total variance. The acoustic propagation model Bellhop is used to estimate TL for a given SSP and different thresholds of TL are used to represent communications performance. Machine-learning models are trained with binarized Bellhop outputs to indicate locations of improved underwater acoustic communications. Amplitude values, desired TL, vehicle depth, and range are used as inputs into machine-learning models for optimizing TL. The best trained model was a random forest (ensemble) network with a 93.3% dice score. The decision tree had a faster prediction speed, relative to Bellhop, with similar prediction accuracy as the ensemble. This work aims to improve sound awareness of AUVs by generating SSP-informed communication performance maps.},

	abstract = {The expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs) is a core focus of global conservation efforts, with the “30x30” initiative to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030 serving as a prominent example of this trend. We consider a series of proposed MPA network expansions of various sizes, and we forecast the impact this increase in protection would have on global patterns of fishing effort. We do so by building a predictive machine learning model trained on a global dataset of satellite-based fishing vessel monitoring data, current MPA locations, and spatiotemporal environmental, geographic, political, and economic features. We then use this model to predict future fishing effort under various MPA expansion scenarios compared to a business-as-usual counterfactual scenario that includes no new MPAs. The difference between these scenarios represents the predicted change in fishing effort associated with MPA expansion. We find that regardless of the MPA network objectives or size, fishing effort would decrease inside the MPAs, though by much less than 100%. Moreover, we find that the reduction in fishing effort inside MPAs does not simply redistribute outside—rather, fishing effort outside MPAs would also decline. The overall magnitude of the predicted decrease in global fishing effort principally depends on where networks are placed in relation to existing fishing effort. MPA expansion will lead to a global redistribution of fishing effort that should be accounted for in network design, implementation, and impact evaluation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Mussel farming is a major export for New Zealand that is growing fast. A number of tasks in mussel farming can be replaced by using intelligent and automatic approaches to reduce the operational cost and human effort. An important task on mussel farms is to track the position of buoys so that mussel farmers can adjust them on time. To make this process automatic, a number of problems need to be solved. Waterline detection is one necessary step towards effective and efficient buoy detection by separating the water and non-water regions from the large images. To address this, in this paper, we develop a waterline detection approach in which different convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used for image segmentation. Two different loss functions are used in the CNN-based methods and transfer learning is also investigated to further improve the model performance. These methods are applied to detect waterlines from the real-world mussel farm images obtained from the South Island of New Zealand. The results show that the CNN-based waterline detection methods are very effective at detecting waterlines on mussel farm images with a wide range of weather and lighting conditions. The results also show that the transferred CNN models with retraining on new images can also obtain high segmentation performance in terms of F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. These promising results will form a good starting point for the next step of buoy detection by removing a large amount of non-water pixels from the large images.}

As the industry expands into more exposed offshore environments, maintaining proper buoyancy in mussel farm structures becomes increasingly challenging. Buoyancy issues can result in significant product losses through sinking or mussel detachment, creating a critical need for scalable, automated monitoring solutions. This paper introduces BuoyancyNet, a novel deep learning-based method for predicting float buoyancy in mussel aquaculture. Using a labelled dataset of over 36,000 float images from mussel farms, the proposed approach leverages a vision transformer enhanced with one-dimensional convolutional layers to learn spatial relationships between consecutive floats along a float line. BuoyancyNet achieves a 3.5% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy over baseline models and demonstrates robust performance under diverse environmental conditions, including poor lighting and occlusions. By addressing challenges in large-scale buoyancy management, this approach provides a promising step toward more efficient and scalable monitoring solutions for NZ's mussel farming industry.}

Surveillance systems like the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) have become popular globally, providing accurate data on fishing activities and fish abundance in near real-time. Our study demonstrates a procedure to find the best method in machine learning algorithms for detecting fishing operations from surveillance data. VMS data of 3,237 trips conducted by 91 purse seiners targeting short mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma) in Thai waters of the Andaman Sea during 2020 were used for the study. Twenty-five spatiotemporal, environmental, and fisheries-related parameters were investigated as predictors to detect and map the fishing activity. Eight algorithms were used to compare the model performance using cross-validation. The total catch per trip was reallocated to the predicted fishing locations of the trip from the best algorithms to depict the fishing ground. The results show that operation time and vessel speed are essential elements for determining the fishing operation of purse seiners. The most-relevant predictors are the calculated speed, operation time, and instantaneous speed. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm performed the best, with 86% accuracy, and therefore was used as the final model to detect the fishing operations. However, all reallocation approaches performed similarly well in depicting fish distribution. The allocation of catch data equally to the fishing position is recommended since it is the most straightforward technique. In contrast, reallocation catch using the RF algorithm prediction ratio for visualising the CPUE distribution achieved the best performance (with a slope of 1) compared with the training data. This study provides the first decent procedures for using surveillance information to detect and identify the prospective fishing operation of purse seiners—an approach that allows for a better understanding of short mackerel distribution. The proposed procedures should help with time–area-based management of intensively exploited migratory fish species, which requires rapid and accurate information. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Spatiotemporal patterns in fishing effort and catch per unit effort (CPUE) were then visualized in relation to the closures in different statistical management zones. The results show that fishing effort in the ADS increased in 2020 from 2018 and 2019, and peaked in 2019 in the GOT. No significant spatiotemporal trend in the distribution of CPUE was identified over the 3 years. Notably, the results reveal spatiotemporal adjustments to fishing effort and CPUE following the implementation of seasonal closures. This study is the first to present a practical approach to using vessel surveillance data to examine seasonal patterns in fishing effort and estimated fish distribution in Thai waters. The findings improve our understanding of fishing effort in response to area closures. The information generated here supports the time–area management of an intensively exploited migratory fish species, given timely and accurate information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Fish-Vista contains 69,269 annotated images spanning 4,316 fish species, curated and organized to serve three downstream tasks: species classification, trait identification, and trait segmentation. Our work makes two key contributions. First, we provide a fully reproducible data processing pipeline to process fish images sourced from various museum collections, contributing to the advancement of AI in biodiversity science. We annotate the images with carefully curated labels from biological databases and manual annotations to create an AI-ready dataset of visual traits. Second, our work offers fertile grounds for researchers to develop novel methods for a variety of problems in computer vision such as handling long-tailed distributions, out-of-distribution generalization, learning with weak labels, explainable AI, and segmenting small objects.

We propose FishNet, an automated computer vision system for both taxonomic classification and fish size estimation from images captured with a low-cost digital camera. The system first performs object detection and segmentation using a Mask R-CNN to identify individual fish from images containing multiple fish, possibly consisting of different species. Then each fish species is classified and the length is predicted using separate machine learning models. To develop the model, we use a dataset of 300,000 hand-labeled images containing 1.2M fish of 163 different species and ranging in length from 10 cm to 250 cm, with additional annotations and quality control methods used to curate high-quality training data. On held-out test data sets, our system achieves a 92 % intersection over union on the fish segmentation task, a 89% top-l classification accuracy on single fish species classification, and a 2.3 cm mean absolute error on the fish length estimation task. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As the world population continues to grow, there is a need to come up with alternative sources of feed and food to combat the existing challenge of food insecurity across the globe. The use of insects, particularly the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens (L.) (Diptera: Stratiomydiae), as a source of feed stands out due to its sustainability and reliability. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have the ability to convert organic substrates to high-quality biomass rich in protein for animal feed. They can also produce biodiesel and bioplastic and have high biotechnological and medical potential. However, current BSFL production is low to meet the industry’s needs. This study used machine learning modeling approaches to discern optimal rearing conditions for improved BSF farming. The input variables studied include the cycle time in each rearing phase (i.e., the rearing period in each phase), feed formulation type, length of the beds (i.e, rearing platforms) at each phase, amount of young larvae added in the first phase, purity score (i.e, percentage of BSFL after separating from the substrate), feed depth, and the feeding rate. The output/target variable was the mass of wet larvae harvested (kg per meter) at the end of the rearing cycle. This data was trained on supervised machine learning algorithms. From the trained models, the random forest regressor presented the best root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.91 and an R-squared value of 80.9%, implying that the model can be used to effectively monitor and predict the expected weight of BSFL to be harvested at the end of the rearing process. The results established that the top five ranked important features that inform optimal production are the length of the beds, feed formulation used, the average number of young larvae loaded in each bed, feed depth, and cycle time. Therefore, in that priority, it is expected that tuning the mentioned parameters to fall within the required levels would result in an increased mass of BSFL harvest. These data science and machine learning techniques can be adopted to understand rearing conditions and optimize the production/farming of BSF as a source of feed for animals e.g., fish, pigs, poultry, etc. A high production of these animals guarantees more food for humans, thus reducing food insecurity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As acoustic datasets become more common, computational techniques need to be developed to facilitate analysis of the massive data files produced by long-term monitoring. Machine learning techniques demonstrate an advantage in the identification of fish sounds over manual sampling ap - proaches. Here we evaluated the ability of convolutional neural networks to identify and monitor call patterns for pomacentrids (damselfishes) in a tropical reef region of the western Pacific. A stationary hydrophone was deployed for 39 mo (2014-2018) in the National Park of American Samoa to continuously record the local marine acoustic environment. A neural network was trained- achieving 94% identification accuracy of pomacentrids-to demonstrate the applicability of machine learning in fish acoustics and ecology. The distribution of sound production was found to vary on diel and interannual timescales. Additionally, the distribution of sound production was correlated with wind speed, water temperature, tidal amplitude, and sound pressure level. This re - search has broad implications for state-of-the-art acoustic analysis and promises to be an efficient, scalable asset for ecological research, environmental monitoring, and conservation planning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Marine aquaculture, particularly in the Mediterranean region, faces the challenge of minimizing growth dispersion, which has a direct impact on the production cycle, market value and sustainability of the sector. Conventional grading methods are resource intensive and potentially detrimental to fish health. The current study presented an innovative approach in predicting fish weight dispersion in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) aquaculture. Seabass is one of the two major fish species cultivated on the Mediterranean coast, with a fattening cycle of 18–24 months. During this period, several grading operations are carried out to minimize growth dispersion. The intricate feed-fish-water system, characterized by complex interactions among feeding regimes, fish behavior, individual metabolism and environmental factors, is the focus of the study. The comprehensive, five-step methodology addresses this complexity. The process begins with a Discrete Event System (DES) model that simulates the feed-fish-water dynamics, taking into account individual fish metabolism. This is followed by the development of a surrogate machine learning (ML) regressor model, which is trained on DES simulation data to efficiently predict growth distribution. The model is then calibrated and customized for specific fish stocks and production tanks. The preliminary results from 21 tanks in two trials with European seabass (D. labrax) showed the effectiveness of the method. The results from the simulation models achieved a R<sup>2</sup> of 99.9 % and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.1 % for the prediction of mean final weight and a R<sup>2</sup> of 90.3 % with a MAPE of 8.1 % for the standard deviation of final weight. In summary, this study represents a significant advance in the planning and management of seabass aquaculture. Given the lack of effective prediction tools in the aquaculture industry, the proposed methodology has the potential to reduce risks and inefficiencies, thus possibly optimizing aquaculture practices by increasing sustainability and profitability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Rivers and agricultural canals form a network that serves as an important habitat for aquatic ecosystems. Urbanization, field development, and water pollution have led to the deterioration of aquatic environments, resulting in the loss of bio-diversity therein, making ecosystem conservation and restoration a pressing issue. Freshwater fish that inhabit agricultural channel networks are significantly affected by changes in flow regimes due to irrigation, and it is essential to consider seasonal changes in both natural and anthropogenic flow dynamics for effective ecosystem conservation. Species distribution models are valuable tools for quantitatively assessing species-habitat relationships. This study examines the applicability of multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning (MoFGBML) to fish habitat assessment for major species recorded in an ecohydraulic survey dataset of an irrigation system located in a suburb of Tokyo. MoFGBML generates fuzzy if-then rule based species distribution models with different tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability. Our focus is the model interpretability and knowledge extraction from the species distribution model, specifically feature importance and rules in relation to the model accuracy. We also show the importance of the temporal information in fish habitat assessment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Mussel farming is a major industry in New Zealand that is currently growing fast. With the expansion of the industry, it has become important to allow the required processes to scale efficiently, which can be aided through the automation of tasks. One of these processes is harvest assessments, which are currently done manually by trained individuals who generally rely on their domain knowledge to perform the assessments rather than following a fixed standard. In this paper we propose the usage of real-time instance segmentation techniques to provide the basis for a tool that mussel farmers can use to automatically perform harvest assessments. Three neural network based real-time techniques were tested, YOLACT, CenterMask, and BlendMask, as well as Mask R-CNN. Mask R-CNN had the highest Mean Average Precision (AP) of 68.2 with a frame rate of 0.109 fps. CenterMask had the second highest AP at 63.7 with a frame rate of 0.278 fps. YOLACT had a final AP of 62.4 with a frame rate of 0.394. BlendMask had the lowest final AP at 60.9, with a frame rate of 0.354 fps. Though none of the techniques ran at real-time without an accelerator, the inference time for all three real-time methods was below 4 seconds. With the ability to run inferences on multiple mussels at a time, a non-real-time application using these techniques would still decrease the time taken to perform harvest assessments.}

It can be exploited in fish farms to automate everyday procedures including size measurement and optimal harvest time estimation, fish health assessment, quantification of feeding needs, etc. It can also be used in an open sea environment to monitor fish size, behavior and the population of various species. An efficient deep learning technique for fish detection is employed and adapted, while methods for fish tracking are also proposed. The fish orientation is classified in order to apply a shape alignment technique that is based on the Ensemble of Regression Trees machine learning method. Shape alignment allows the estimation of fish dimensions (length, height) and the localization of fish body parts of particular interest such as the eyes and gills. The proposed method can estimate the position of 18 landmarks with an accuracy of about 95% from low-contrast underwater images where the fish can be hardly distinguished from its background. Hardware and software acceleration techniques have been applied at the shape alignment process reducing the frame processing latency to less than 0.5 us on a general purpose computer and less than 16 ms on an embedded platform. As a case study, the developed system has been trained and tested with several Mediterranean fish species in the category of seabream. A large public dataset with low-resolution underwater videos and images has also been developed to test the proposed system under worst case conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We have developed an algorithm to map benthic habitats on the continental shelf of South Africa, integrating marine geophysics and biological science. Multibeam bathymetry, backscatter and Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) footage were collected on the inner continental shelf of Cape St Francis and the hydroacoustic data were processed using machine learning clustering techniques. The k-means clustering algorithm was used to map the distribution of sediment at different depths. ROV footage was classified using the Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery (CATAMI) substrata classification scheme. Eight ROV dives along the three transects located off Seal Point, Cape St. Francis Point and within the bay were collected, and ranged from 30 to 80 m in depth. The most common Phyla in order from greatest to least abundance were; Cnidaria, Mollusca, Echinodermata, Chordata (fish species), Arthropoda (Subphylum Crustacea), Bryozoa, Porifera and Chordata (Class Ascidiacea), these were identified both on rocky substrate and sand. The first benthic habitat map of the Cape St. Francis area revealed ten different habitat types, accounting for geology, topography, and sediment cover. This work builds on an ongoing method development that incorporates broader habitat types from a range of substrates, enhancing the robustness of the algorithm, and will aid in improving our current understanding of the relationships between biota and physical habitats along the continental shelf of South Africa. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Automatic identification of fish species is very complex and challenging because of the low quality of the marine environment. Thus, the identification of fish species using computer vision technology is disrupted. However, various researchers only focus on determining the best fish identification method without considering the quality of the data used. Therefore, this study presented a new workflow in identifying fish species. A combination of feature extraction methods and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) method was used, which was based on image quality improvement techniques using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) with adaptive threshold by fuzzy c-means. This study compared the results of fish identification on the original data and image data that were enhanced using several classifications of machine learning. The results show that data with improved quality of the images will improve accuracy for fish species identification and improvement using the proposed method of 3.56%. This could support the reduction of invasive fish populations through automated fish identification systems in unrestricted natural environments based on computer vision technology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={As a key component of aquatic food webs and a major contributor to global biogeochemical cycles, plankton identification and classification are critical tasks in marine biology. While identifying and categorizing plankton species manually can be time-consuming, it requires considerable expertise. Machine learning approaches are proposed here for identifying and categorizing plankton. As well as providing insights into plankton ecology and biogeochemistry, automatic identification and classification of plankton species can inform management strategies for marine ecosystems. Training the model required a dataset of images of phytoplankton and zooplankton, which were classified into multiple categories by the model. The model was also evaluated for robustness against noise, occlusion, and illumination variations. A threshold-based segmentation method is used to detect plankton objects during the classification phase. Plankton classification using this threshold-based segmentation method requires the extraction of features from the image, such as shape, size, color, and texture. These features are used to categorize the different species of plankton. The model was then tested on field images to validate its accuracy. The results showed that the model was able to achieve high accuracy in classifying the different plankton species.},

  abstract={Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have achieved great success in plankton image recognition, but most of them are proposed to deal with closed-set tasks, where the distribution of the test data is the same as the training one. In reality, however, we face the challenges of open-set tasks, which are also recognized as the anomaly detection problems. In these tasks, there often exist abnormal classes, which are not in the training set, and the final goal of anomaly detection is to detect the anomalies correctly so that the misclassification of them can be reduced. However, little attention has been paid to anomaly detection in marine related fields. In this paper, to help marine plankton observers to detect anomalies conveniently and efficiently, we propose an anomaly detection pipeline including both the training and the testing phases. The training phase includes two parts, the pre-training and the post-training. In the pre-training phase, we propose a new loss function to better detect the abnormal classes and classify the normal classes simultaneously, which incorporates the expected cross-entropy loss, the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the Anchor loss. We conduct several experiments to show the efficacy of the proposed method and compare its performance with other competitors based on a newly released dataset of in situ marine plankton images. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms its competitors in terms of classification accuracy and other commonly used criteria.},

  abstract = {For the purpose of monitoring fish health, managing aquaculture, and comprehending marine ecology, there is a growing interest in the automatic classification of different fish species. Recent developments in machine vision-based classification methods, known for their speed and non-destructive nature, have led to the introduction of various automatic categorization approaches. Drawing inspiration from FishNet, a new architecture model named ConvFishNet has been proposed. This model incorporates large convolutional kernels and depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters in the model. Additionally, the PixelShuffle has been developed to enhance the upsampling information and improve fish classification performance. While maintaining precision in fish classification, the model achieves a lightweight design with only 0.83G. Compared with the FishNet model, the new model reduces parameters by 80 %. The model demonstrates a precision of 88.44 % on the WildFish dataset subset and 99.8 % on the Fish4knowledge dataset, surpassing existing methods including FishNet. This method shows promise for fish classification in challenging underwater environments, such as marine and aquaculture settings, and further investigation is planned for the future.}

	abstract = {Concerning the oversight and safeguarding of aquatic environments, it is necessary to ascertain the quantity of fish, their size, and their distribution. Many deep learning (DL), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) techniques have been developed to oversee and safeguard the fish species. Still, all the previous work had some limitations, such as a limited dataset, only binary class categorization, only employing one technique (ML/DL), etc. Therefore, in the proposed work, the authors develop an architecture that will eliminate all the limitations. Both DL and ML techniques were used in the suggested framework to identify and categorize multiple classes of the salinity and freshwater fish species. Two different datasets of fish images with thirteen fish species were employed in the current research. Seven CNN architectures were implemented to find out the important features of the fish images. Then, seven ML classifiers were utilized in the suggested work to identify the binary class (freshwater and salinity) of fish species. Following that, the multiclass classification of thirteen fish species was evaluated through the ML algorithms, where the present model diagnosed the freshwater or salinity fish in the specific fish species. To achieve the primary goals of the proposed study, several assessments of the experimental data are provided. The results of the investigation indicated that DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19 architectures of the CNN with SVC ML technique achieved 100% accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall for binary classification (freshwater/salinity) of fish images. Additionally, the ResNet50 architecture of the CNN with SVC ML technique achieved 98.06% and 100% accuracy for multiclass classification (freshwater and salinity fish species) of fish images. However, the proposed pipeline can be very effective in sustainable fish management in fish identification and classification. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These diseases, often caused by viruses and bacteria, disrupt water quality parameters, leading to fish mortality. Inspired by recent successes in machine learning, this study utilizes cutting-edge algorithms to swiftly and accurately detect and predict water quality degradation. This research proposes the use of machine learning techniques to enable early identification of diseases in fish populations by predicting deteriorating water quality conditions. The aim is to provide stakeholders with a system that allows them to take preventive actions before disease outbreaks occur. The study evaluated the performance of several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Random Forest classifiers, in predicting disease occurrences. Among these techniques, the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, achieving 98.97% correct classification of diseased and non-diseased cases. This integration of machine learning enhances aquaculture management, safeguarding against economic losses and fostering sector resilience.

	abstract = {There were specific regions that were recognized by the abundance of paddy and aquaculture. Every season and throughout the year, aqua crops are increasing, and many farmers are converting their cultivated lands into aqua ponds to gain more income than from normal seasonal crops. In order to increase production in the aqua crop, a few significant enhancements and technology-oriented principles are being adopted. One of the factors considered a challenge is feeding the fish and related aqua stock. The other factor is an efficient approach that processes and classifies specific species. The competitive challenges influence the production enhancement in order to get the expected returns. To address and overcome both these challenges, a hybrid deep learning approach is used and implemented in the observation of aqua farming, and effective monitoring of the aqua ponds is provided using sensors. The proposed method, which consists of CNN, LSTM, and Bagging, is useful for classifying the species. The integration of IoT sensors recommends that the pond life always be healthy, and also alerts the farmer on specific species classification for easy identification and marketing. The samples from specific regions are taken as a study, and reported successful classification is reported using modern technologies like the integration of machine learning and the Internet of Things in the model. The accuracy of the proposed model in the context of aqua ponds and normal aqua ponds is analyzed.

Using data on Chanda nama fish distribution (presence/absence) and associated ten physical and chemical parameters of water at 22 sampling sites of the river collected during the year 2001–2002, machine learning models such as random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors were used for classification of Chanda nama distribution in the river. The machine learning model efficiency was evaluated using classification accuracy, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver-operating-characteristics. Results showed that random forest is the best model with higher classification accuracy (82%), Cohen’s kappa coefficient (0.55), sensitivity (0.57), specificity (0.76), and receiver-operating-characteristics (0.72) for prediction of the occurrence of Chanda nama in the Krishna River.

This research validates a novel computer vision methodology that uses a signature function-based feature extraction algorithm combining statistical morphological analysis of the size and shape of fish and machine learning to improve the accuracy of biomass estimation in fishponds and is specifically applied to tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). These features that are automatically extracted from images are put to the test against previously manually extracted features by comparing the results when applied to three common machine learning methods under two different lighting conditions. The dataset for this analysis encompasses 129 tilapia samples. The results give promising outcomes since the multilayer perceptron model shows robust performance, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy across different features and lighting conditions. The interpretable nature of the model, rooted in the statistical features of the signature function, could provide insights into the morphological and allometric changes at different developmental stages. A comparative analysis against existing literature underscores the competitiveness of the proposed methodology, pointing to advancements in precision, interpretability, and species versatility. This research contributes significantly to the field, accelerating the quest for non-invasive fish biometrics that can be generalized across various aquaculture species in different stages of development.

Conventional approaches to fisheries stock assessment impose constraints on our comprehension of fish population dynamics. These limitations can be overcome through the utilization of machine learning techniques, which enable the forecasting and modeling of fisheries populations with improved accuracy and understanding. In this study, the commercial fisheries populations data collected from 2018 to 2021 in Manila Bay were used to predict the abundance of species fisheries production data using the K-NN - MLP - Logistic Regression (KNMLPR) model based on the majority voting ensemble approach. Analysis revealed that it is possible to combine the strengths of multiple models and improve overall predictive performance.

However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  journal = {Genes},
  year    = {2022},
  volume  = {13},
  number  = {7},
  doi     = {10.3390/genes13071129},
  abstract = {Background
Genetic diversity provides the basic substrate for evolution. Genetic variation consists of changes ranging from single base pairs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) to larger-scale structural variants, such as inversions, deletions, and duplications. SNPs have long been used as the general currency for investigations into how genetic diversity fuels evolution. However, structural variants can affect more base pairs in the genome than SNPs and can be responsible for adaptive phenotypes due to their impact on linkage and recombination. In this study, we investigate the first steps needed to explore the genetic basis of an economically important growth trait in the marine teleost finfish Chrysophrys auratus using both SNP and structural variant data. Specifically, we use feature selection methods in machine learning to explore the relative predictive power of both types of genetic variants in explaining growth and discuss the feature selection results of the evaluated methods.
Methods
SNP and structural variant callers were used to generate catalogues of variant data from 32 individual fish at ages 1 and 3 years. Three feature selection algorithms (ReliefF, Chi-square, and a mutual-information-based method) were used to reduce the dataset by selecting the most informative features. Following this selection process, the subset of variants was used as features to classify fish into small, medium, or large size categories using KNN, naïve Bayes, random forest, and logistic regression. The top-scoring features in each feature selection method were subsequently mapped to annotated genomic regions in the zebrafish genome, and a permutation test was conducted to see if the number of mapped regions was greater than when random sampling was applied.
Results
Without feature selection, the prediction accuracies ranged from 0 to 0.5 for both structural variants and SNPs. Following feature selection, the prediction accuracy increased only slightly to between 0 and 0.65 for structural variants and between 0 and 0.75 for SNPs. The highest prediction accuracy for the logistic regression was achieved for age 3 fish using SNPs, although generally predictions for age 1 and 3 fish were very similar (ranging from 0–0.65 for both SNPs and structural variants). The Chi-square feature selection of SNP data was the only method that had a significantly higher number of matches to annotated genomic regions of zebrafish than would be explained by chance alone.
Conclusions
Predicting a complex polygenic trait such as growth using data collected from a low number of individuals remains challenging. While we demonstrate that both SNPs and structural variants provide important information to help understand the genetic basis of phenotypic traits such as fish growth, the full complexities that exist within a genome cannot be easily captured by classical machine learning techniques. When using high-dimensional data, feature selection shows some increase in the prediction accuracy of classification models and provides the potential to identify unknown genomic correlates with growth. Our results show that both SNPs and structural variants significantly impact growth, and we therefore recommend that researchers interested in the genotype–phenotype map should strive to go beyond SNPs and incorporate structural variants in their studies as well. We discuss how our machine learning models can be further expanded to serve as a test bed to inform evolutionary studies and the applied management of species.}

	abstract = {With the ever increasing world population, there is a critical need for healthy food resources. Fish are the most environmentally-friendly animal protein to produce, efficiently converting feed into meat while generating a fraction of the greenhouse gasses of livestock production. Therefore, fish farming is one of the most important fields for a sustainable future. Since there is no way for fishes in fish farming pools to migrate into healthier water, a key factor in this industry is to maintain the water quality in standard conditions. Out of different key measurements used to quantify water quality, pH is among the essentials. In this study a portable, cheap, non contact, reusable, and machine learning-based pH sensing system is introduced. This helps farmers to quantify the pH quality of their pools without spending significant amounts of money on measurement equipment. This work introduces a sensitive, non-invasive and reflection-based optical sensor along with an Autoencoder-ESN framework for pH sensing. Using the Autoencoder guarantees at least 5 percent better classification in comparison with simple Echo State Networks. Long lifetimes of the sensor along with high sensitivity of the machine learning algorithm makes this system valuable for local farmers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In order to improve fish illness detection and fish species recognition two crucial facets of aquatic ecosystem management this study focusses on utilising deep learning techniques. This study investigates how deep learning may dramatically increase the precision and effectiveness of fish population monitoring by using cutting-edge neural network designs. The study's first section explores the categorisation of fish species, showing how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can successfully differentiate between several species using visual characteristics like colour, texture, and form. Through the analysis of bulk data containing illness symptoms and fish health markers based on both deep learning and conventional machine learning models, the second module tackles the early diagnosis of fish diseases. The models are taught to identify microscopic patterns and anomalies that may signal the presence of illnesses in aquaculture, hence enabling prompt intervention and preventative actions. The results demonstrate how deep learning-based methods have the potential to completely transform fish population management, guaranteeing sustainability, disease prevention, and improved decision-making in aquatic resource conservation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {It is interesting to develop effective fish sampling techniques using underwater videos and image processing to automatically estimate and consequently monitor the fish biomass and assemblage in water bodies. Such approaches should be robust against substantial variations in scenes due to poor luminosity, orientation of fish, seabed structures, movement of aquatic plants in the background and image diversity in the shape and texture among fish of different species. Keeping this challenge in mind, we propose a unified approach to detect freely moving fish in unconstrained underwater environments using a Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network, a state-of-the-art machine learning technique used to solve generic object detection and localization problems. To train the neural network, we employ a novel approach to utilize motion information of fish in videos via background subtraction and optical flow, and subsequently combine the outcomes with the raw image to generate fish-dependent candidate regions. We use two benchmark datasets extracted from a large Fish4Knowledge underwater video repository, Complex Scenes dataset and the LifeCLEF 2015 fish dataset to validate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach. We achieve a detection accuracy (F-Score) of 87.44% and 80.02% respectively on these datasets, which advocate the utilization of our approach for fish detection task. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study investigates the influence of pH, temperature, light intensity, light colour and CO2 concentration on biomass and biochemical composition in five algal genera (Chlorella, Botryococcus, Chlamydomonas, Tetraselmis and Closterium). Algal samples were isolated from aquatic environments in KPK-Pakistan and cultured under controlled conditions. Environmental variables were systematically varied: pH, temperature, light intensity, light colour and CO2 concentration. Biochemical analyses revealed biomass ranging from 0.2 to 2.1 g l−1, lipids 7.2–24.5% and proteins 8–49.5%, with optimal conditions of pH 7, 30°C, red light, 3000 lux and 9% CO₂. Machine learning was applied to optimize environmental conditions, with random forest (RF) identified as the most effective model. A novel metric, W_new, combining performance and error metrics, facilitated robust model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning. The model’s feature importance analysis ranked CO₂ concentration and pH as the most influential factors. RF achieved R² scores of 0.686 (training) and 0.534 (validation), demonstrating strong predictive performance. This study integrates experimental and computational approaches, providing a detailed framework for optimizing algal cultivation.

  abstract={Oilfish is banned in some countries because of the unpleasant side-effects of eating oilfish. However, oilfish was easily mislabeled and sold as cod due to their closed appearance. In this study, an in situ and real-time method was developed to distinguish cod from oilfish by coupling intelligent surgical knife (iKnife) and rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS). The fillets collected from the same position of adult fishes were analyzed directly without sample preparation. The iKnife-REIMS conditions were optimized as cutting speed ca. 5 mm·s−1 and stripe length 2 cm, power output 30 W, and flow rate of auxiliary solvent (propan-2-ol) 100 μL·min–1. 200 spectral data from oilfish and cod was acquired in negative ionization mode and the data was processed by background subtraction, peak detection, and absolute counts calculation, which were further statistically analyzed by multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-square analysis (OPLS-DA). The major contributors of cluster separation were verified by permutation test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The identities of oilfish and cod (Greenland cod, Pacific cod, and Atlantic cod) were successfully recognized with accuracy 96–100%. This study filled the application niche of REIMS in cod authenticity and paved the way for the administration of food security and quality for related functional departments and bureaus.}

In this study, a surgical knife, namely iKnife, was coupled to rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) to develop a high-throughput technique for in situ and real-time authenticating these two fish species. The iKnife generated informative aerosol, which was further aspired into mass spectrometry to acquire specific fingerprinting profiles. The spectra were multivariate statistical analyzed, and the most contributing ions responsible for the significant difference between the lipidomics profiles of basa catfish and sole fish were screened out. For instance, ions of m/z 281.2470, 279.2319, 699.4970, etc. were abundance in basa catfish, while m/z 301.2164, 327.2341, 764.5284, etc. were significant in sole fish. Subsequently, the validation of the method was carried out in terms of intra-day precision (RSD 5.06%–8.65%) and inter-day precision (RSD ≤9.17%). Finally, this established iKnife-REIMS method was successfully applied to blind samples from markets with an accuracy greater than 98%. The results indicated that the proposed iKnife REIMS method could be used to unambiguously authenticate these two easily adulterated basa catfish and sole fish, and provide the basis and potential for the high-throughput identification of marine resources on the market.}

Otolith shape is commonly used as the marker of distinct stocks in discrimination studies. Our literature review showed that the application and comparison of alternative statistical classifiers to discriminate fish stocks based on otolith shape is limited. Therefore, we compared the performance of two traditional and four machine learning classifiers based on Fourier analysis of otolith shape using selected stocks of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the southern Baltic Sea and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in the western Norwegian Sea, Skagerrak, and the southern Baltic Sea. Our results showed that the stocks can be successfully discriminated based on their otolith shapes. We observed significant differences in the accuracy obtained by the tested classifiers. For both species, support vector machines (SVM) resulted in the highest classification accuracy. These findings suggest that modern machine learning algorithms, like SVM, can help to improve the accuracy of fish stock discrimination systems based on the otolith shape. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Plankton plays a vital role in sustaining life on Earth as it forms the foundation of the aquatic food chain. Additionally, it is responsible for producing approximately half of the oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere. Understanding the distribution of plankton is crucial in studying climate change and monitoring water quality. This study utilized a dataset comprising 30,336 plankton images belonging to 121 different classes. State-of-the-art deep learning methods were employed to automatically label the plankton species, while alternative training approaches, data augmentation, and preprocessing techniques were compared to assess their impact. The study analyzed the similarities between and within plankton classes, as well as the classes that were frequently misidentified. By training models on networks from two different versions of the Kaggle dataset, the highest success rate achieved was 78% on the larger dataset with 118 classes, and 92% on the smaller dataset with 38 classes using individual models. These results represent a 1% improvement over the previously reported best-performing single model classifiers. Furthermore, by employing an averaging ensemble method, the performance was further enhanced by 2% in the first dataset and 1% in the second dataset. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in accurately identifying plankton species and highlight the potential for improving classification results through ensemble techniques. Also, we address the unbalance and the varying input sizes within the Kaggle plankton dataset. We propose alternative data balancing methods and investigate three pre-processing techniques. Then we compare several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and show the improvement in classification rates with ensemble methods. Our results have significantly improved the best results reported in the literature over the single best models.},

Manual monitoring is expensive, resulting in most caught fish going unmonitored onvessel. The small sample size from the current approach is prone to information loss and biases. The application of machine learning in the fishing industry provides the opportunity to gain a broader understanding of the ecological impact of current fishing practices. This research explores the potential of deep learning in the context of computer vision to better monitor fish catch. It presents an approach to estimating the length of individual fish in millimetres from the output of a segmentation mask by a U-net-based neural network using an EfficientNet backbone. Our approach produced results that were, on average, within one centimetre of the measured lengths of fish, prior to any adjustment for halo effects of segmentation inferences.}

	abstract = {Survival of out-migrating juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta averages less than 33 percent, depending on water flow through the delta, and is partially governed by the distribution of fish among three Sacramento River distributaries: Sutter, Steamboat, and Georgiana sloughs. Behavioral altering structures in the junctions of the distributaries can effectively increase entrainment into favorable routes, thereby increasing through-delta (Verona to Chips Island, California) survival. The effectiveness of these structures, hence forth called “behavioral barriers,” are dependent on shape, length, location, barrier type, and water velocity, which is governed by Sacramento River discharge (hereinafter referred to as “flow”). We developed a machine learning tool to optimize behavioral barrier designs at up to three junctions within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for improving through-delta survival of juvenile winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). This barrier optimization tool (BOT) works by evolving barrier solutions in one to three junctions by repeatedly simulating survival of populations of Sacramento River origin fish as they pass through the Delta. Over approximately 6,000 simulations per junction, the BOT converges on barrier designs that result in the greatest average survival given simulated environmental conditions. Survival at each iteration of the model is simulated using a modified version of the salmon travel time and routing simulation (STARS) model. In the BOT, STARS is modified by replacing probabilistic route determinations with an individual based model (IBM) that simulates fish behavior to predict the entrainment rates in each junction. The IBM allows the flexibility to explore how entrainment changes with evolving barrier designs. We used juvenile winter-run-sized Chinook salmon catch data collected at Knights Landing from 1997 to 2011 to create realistic arrival and spatial distributions of simulated fish within the BOT that varied among water years (hereafter years). We demonstrated the capabilities of the BOT by comparing optimized barrier solutions and their resulting simulated improvement in survival among three scenarios that differed in the number of junctions with barriers (Georgiana Slough, Steamboat Slough, or both) and the barrier operational period (early: November 1–March 15, or late: January 1– April 30). In this initial demonstration of the BOT we only considered a bioacoustic fish fence (BAFF) at Georgiana Slough and a floating fish guidance structure (FFGS) at Steamboat Slough. The increase in simulated through-delta fish survival ranged from 1.0 to 6.3 percent among the optimized barrier designs. The most effective Georgiana Slough barrier design predicted improved survival by 6.3 percent and was chosen by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) as the Georgiana Slough salmon migratory barrier planned for operation annually from 2023 to 2030 at Georgiana Slough in response to the 2020 California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s (CDFW) Incidental Take Permit Minimization Measure 8.9.1 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife[CDFW], 2020). When barriers were simulated in both junctions, the percentages of simulated winter-run Chinook salmon interacting with a barrier at Steamboat or Georgiana sloughs were 95 percent given the early operational period and 48 percent given the late operational period. When barriers were simulated at both sloughs, the optimal barrier at Steamboat Slough effectively routed fish into the Sacramento River. This is because the Georgiana Slough barrier reduced routing into Georgiana Slough where survival is low, which resulted in higher survival for fish routed down the Sacramento River at Steamboat Slough than fish routed down Steamboat Slough. Whereas when no barrier was simulated at Georgiana Slough, the optimized barrier at Steamboat Slough routed fish into Steamboat Slough. This is because survival was higher through Steamboat Slough than the Sacramento River and Georgiana Slough combined. The greatest improvement in survival (6.3 percent) was predicted over the earlier operational period with only a barrier at Georgiana Slough. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The accurate detection and quantification of submerged targets has been recognized as a key challenge in marine exploration, one that traditional census approaches cannot handle efficiently. Here we present a deep learning approach to detect the pattern of a moving fish from the reflections of an active acoustic emitter. To allow for real-time detection, we use a convolutional neural network, which provides the simultaneous labeling of a large buffer of signal samples. This allows to capture the structure of the reflecting signal from the moving target and to separate it from clutter reflections. We evaluate system performance both on synthetic (simulated) data, as well as on real data recorded over 50 sea experiments in a variety of sea conditions. When tested on real signals, the network trained on simulated patterns showed non-trivial detection capabilities, suggesting that transfer learning can be a viable approach in these scenarios, where tagged data is often lacking. However, training the network directly on the real reflections with data augmentation techniques allowed to reach a more favorable precision-recall trade-off, approaching an ideal detection bound. We also evaluate an alternative model based on recurrent neural networks which, despite exhibiting slightly inferior performance, could be applied in scenarios requiring on-line processing of the reflection sequence.},

  abstract={The fisheries sector in Colombia plays a significant role, contributing 0.3% to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and generating exports worth US∃45.1 million, equivalent to 3.3% of the agricultural GDP. However, its management faces challenges such as non-target species fishing, inadequate control of overfishing, and resource management issues, among others, affecting fish production. This article highlights the necessity of enhancing chlorophyll-a measurement to op-timize fishery production. Chlorophyll-a measurements are vital indicators of marine ecosystem health. Utilizing satellite imagery like MODIS is crucial for accurate data collection. However, Colombia's geographic location, characterized by high cloud cover, compromises image quality for much of the year, posing significant limitations on reporting chlorophyll-a values. We propose a machine learning algorithm to predict chlorophyll-A values on MODIS images to address this issue. The approach demonstrates an accuracy exceeding 0.8 regarding R-squared for predicting missing chlorophyll-a values. By overcoming spatial limitations caused by cloud cover, this method enables a more precise assessment of fishing grounds. Various machine learning models were also applied and evaluated within the research's context. Results yielded a 5% recovery yield of chlorophyll-a values for 2023, enriching knowledge and management practices within Colombia's fishing sector.},

Dynamic nature of oceans make it very challenging to monitor these microscopic organisms. Our approach here is to generate a powerful automated plankton recognition system to autonomously identify them and improve the D-CNN for classification of the Plankton holographic imagery curated with the method of Data Conformity Evaluation. The performance of D-CNN classifier is improved by various hyper-parameter tuning, regularization techniques and appending meta-data. Conformity evaluation is based on a matric that's calculated on a continuously refined sequence of calculated L1-norm tensor subspaces of the Plankton images.

	abstract = {Understanding how species respond to the environment is essential in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Abiotic factors can influence species responses and the multi-dimensional space of abiotic factors that allows a species to grow represents the environmental niche. While niches are often assumed to be constant and robust, they are most likely changing over time and estimation can be influenced by population biology, sampling intensity, and computation methodology. Here, we used a 12-year time series of survey data to fit annual ecological niche models (ENMs) for 10 marine fish species by using two regression and two machine learning algorithms to evaluate the variation and differentiation of environmental niches. Fitted ENMs were used to develop multi-dimensional annual and pooled hypervolumes that were evaluated over time and across ENM algorithms, species, and years by computing volume, distance, and dissimilarity metrics for each annual estimated niche. We then investigated potential drivers of estimated hypervolume dynamics including species abundance, species occurrence, sampling effort, salinity, red tides severity, and algorithm. Overall, our results revealed that estimated niches varied over time and across ENM, species, and algorithms. Niche estimation was influenced over time by multiple factors suggesting high complexity on niche dynamics interpretation. Species with high occurrence tended to have a closer representation of the pooled niche and years with higher abundance tended to produce niche expansion. ENM algorithm, sampling effort, seawater salinity, and red tides explained the deviations from the pooled niche. Greater sampling effort led to more comprehensive and complete estimates of species niches. High red tides severity triggered niche contraction. Our results emphasize the predictable effects of population, sampling, and environment on species niche estimation and interpretation, and that each should be considered when performing and interpreting ecological niche analyses. Our niche analysis approach may contribute to effectively quantifying and assessing niche dynamics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Fish species can be identified based on the analysis of morphological indices including basic dimension parameters and shape index. Several pattern recognition methods have been proposed to classify fish species through the morphological characteristics of otolith outlines. Machine learning methods have been applied in various fields, particularly in the differentiation of object shapes. Applying machine learning models to identify species based on basic dimension parameters and shape index of otoliths is highly promising. The purpose of this study is to apply machine learning models to classify marine fish species, aiming to determine which machine learning model and indices are suitable for otolith shape classification. A total of 720 samples of left otoliths (sagittae) from 12 fish species, with 60 individuals per species, were used to develop and evaluate the identification model using Python language. For the first time, a comparative evaluation of six machine learning models and three deep learning models was conducted to distinguish 12 fish species in the nearshore areas of northern and central Vietnam. The results of this study have identified machine learning and deep learning models based on high-performing basic dimension parameter (BDP) and/or shape index ShI indices for species identification. This lays the groundwork for developing software for automatic species or population identification based on otolith morphological analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Biological oceanographers are increasingly adopting machine learning techniques to conduct quantitative as-sessments of marine plankton. Most supervised plankton classifiers are trained on labeled image datasets annotated by domain experts under the closed world assumption: all object classes and their priors are the same during both training and deployment. This assumption, however, is hard to satisfy in the actual ocean where data is subject to dataset shift due to shifting populations and from the introduction of object categories not seen during training. Here we present an alternative approach for training and evaluating plank-ton classifiers under the more realistic open world scenario. We specifically address the problems of out-of-distribution detection and dataset shift under the class imbalance setting where downsampling is needed to reliably detect and classify relatively rare target classes. We apply a hard negative mining approach called Background Resampling to perform downsampling and compare it to other strategies. We show that Background Resampling improves detection of novel particle classes while simultaneously providing competitive classification performance under dataset shift.},

	abstract = {Understanding fish habitats is essential for fisheries management, habitat restoration, and species protection. Automated fish detection is a key tool in these applications, which enables real-time monitoring and quantitative analysis. Recent advancements in high-resolution cameras and machine learning technologies have facilitated image analysis automation, promoting remote fish tracking. However, many of these detection methods require large volumes of annotated data, which involve considerable effort and time. Additionally, their practical implementation remains challenging in environments with limited data. Hence, this study proposes an anomaly-based fish detection approach by integrating Patch Distribution Modeling with data augmentation techniques, including Affine Transformations, Neural Filters, and SinGAN. Field experiments were conducted in Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma, Japan, using an electrofishing boat to acquire data. Evaluation metrics, such as AUROC and F1-score, assessed detection performance. The results indicate that, compared to the original dataset (AUROC: 0.836, F1-score: 0.483), Neural Filters (AUROC: 0.940, F1-score: 0.879) and Affine Transformations (AUROC: 0.942, F1-score: 0.766) improve anomaly detection. However, SinGAN exhibited no measurable enhancement, indicating the necessity for further optimization. This shows the potential of the proposed approach to enhance automated fish detection in limited-data environments, supporting aquatic ecosystem sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Direct localization (DLOC) methods, which use the observed data to localize a source at an unknown position in a one-step procedure, generally outperform their indirect two-step counterparts (e.g., using time-difference of arrivals). However, underwater acoustic DLOC methods require prior knowledge of the environment, and are computationally costly, hence slow. We propose, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first data-driven DLOC method. Inspired by classical and contemporary optimal model-based DLOC solutions, and leveraging the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we devise a holistic CNN-based solution. Our method includes a specifically-tailored input structure, architecture, loss function, and a progressive training procedure, which are of independent interest in the broader context of machine learning. We demonstrate that our method outperforms attractive alternatives, and asymptotically matches the performance of an oracle optimal model-based solution.},

  title={Machine Learning for Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry},
  author={Jesse Wood},
  journal={GitHub},
  year={2025},
  abstract={This thesis advances seafood processing by applying deep learning to Rapid Evaporative
Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) data, enabling automated and accurate marine
biomass analysis.
This research addresses critical industry challenges in quality control, food safety, and
fraud prevention. These include foundational tasks like species identification to com-
bat mislabeling fraud and body part classification to optimize by-product utilization and
prevent adulteration with offal. It also formalizes novel food safety problems, such as
detecting oil contamination (a food safety hazard) and cross-species adulteration (a form
of economic fraud). Finally, it tackles batch traceability, a task essential for rapid product
recalls that currently relies on costly and impractical physical tagging methods.
To achieve this, the thesis first establishes a suite of advanced models for foundational
tasks species and body part identification (Chapter 4), drawing on datasets described in
Chapter 3. Specifically, this involves a binary classification dataset of 106 samples for
Hoki and Mackerel identification and a multi-class dataset of 33 samples for classifying
seven distinct body parts (fillets, heads, livers, skins, gonads, guts, and frames). The
work then formalizes and solves novel food safety problems, including oil contamination
(seven ordinal concentration levels from 50% to 0% in a 126-sample dataset) and cross-
species adulteration (pure Hoki, pure Mackerel, and mixed Hoki-Mackerel samples from
a 144-sample dataset) (Chapter 5), also based on Chapter 3 data. Finally, it introduces
a self-supervised framework to address the challenge of batch traceability using a highly
imbalanced, pairwise comparison dataset of 2,556 instances, derived from 72 fish samples
across 24 distinct batches (Chapter 6). The high-dimensional nature of the REIMS data,
with 2,080 features per spectrum for all tasks, necessitates sophisticated solutions.
Key contributions include the development of advanced Transformer architectures,
which significantly outperform traditional methods by achieving up to 100% accuracy
in species identification. The study also critically evaluates Mixture of Experts (MoE)
Transformers to determine optimal configurations and investigates the asymmetric effects
of transfer learning across different tasks, namely species identification, body part clas-
sification, oil contamination, and cross-species adulteration detection. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis of ordinal classification techniques is included, demonstrating that
models designed for ordered data significantly reduce error distance in graded contami-
nation tasks. For batch traceability, a novel self-supervised contrastive learning method,
SpectroSim, is introduced, which identifies sample origins with 70.8% accuracy without
using class labels. Explainable AI techniques are employed to ensure model predictions
are interpretable, enhancing trust and providing chemically relevant insights.
This research is motivated by the need to overcome the limitations of current state-
of-the-art analytical methods. The standard approach for REIMS analysis relies on tradi-
tional chemometric techniques like Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analy-
sis (OPLS-DA), which are often limited in their ability to model the complex, non-linear,
and high-dimensional nature of mass spectra. For the foundational task of species and
body part identification (Chapter 4), the challenge was to classify samples from complex
and high-dimensional REIMS data. This was addressed by developing novel Transformer
architectures that achieved near-perfect accuracy (up to 100%), establishing a new perfor-
mance benchmark. For the novel tasks of oil contamination and cross-species adulteration
(Chapter 5), the challenge was to detect subtle chemical signatures often masked by the
sample’s primary chemical profile. This was solved by adapting advanced models to these
difficult classification problems and systematically applying transfer learning, which was
found to consistently improve the detection of oil contamination. Finally, for batch trace-
ability (Chapter 6), the challenge was to create a method that avoids costly physical tags
and the need for impractical supervised labels. This was achieved by developing “Spec-
troSim”, a self-supervised framework that accurately determines sample origin without
labels, offering a practical and cost-effective solution for the industry.

Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS), as an emerging food analysis technology, has demonstrated significant potential in FAI due to its real-time, accurate, and in-situ characteristics. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of REIMS technology, encompassing its developmental trajectory, experimental setup, operational procedures, ion sources, and ionization mechanisms. Then, it delves into the application of REIMS in data processing, particularly highlighting the advantages of chemometrics analysis, multivariate statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms in FAI. The review delves into various application cases of REIMS in the food sector, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying food materials, monitoring processing procedures, and rapidly detecting adulteration and fraud. Despite its promise, REIMS faces challenges such as enhancing sensitivity and accuracy and broadening its applicability to diverse ionization targets. In the future, with ongoing technological advancements and in-depth research, REIMS technology will play a more significant role in food safety supervision. In addition, integrating REIMS with other analytical techniques and standardizing FAI processes based on REIMS will be pivotal areas for future research and development. These endeavors will not only bolster the technology's capabilities but also contribute to the sustainable growth of the food industry by ensuring higher standards of food safety and authenticity.},

However, this task is difficult due to the low-quality images and the high inter-class variations across images. Most existing methods use high-quality images for classification and need domain knowledge. In this paper, we develop a genetic programming (GP) approach to automatically selecting image operators to deal with the low-quality images and extracting effective features from these images for low-quality fish image classification. To achieve this, a new program structure and a new function set are developed. With these designs, the proposed GP approach can evolve solutions that use effective filtering or restoration operators to deal with the input image, select informative regions from the fish image, and extract effective global and/or local features from the fish images. The results show that the proposed approach achieves significantly better performance than 12 benchmark methods, including a state-of-the-art GP approach, on the well-known fish image classification dataset. Further analysis shows the high interpretability of the evolved GP trees and the effectiveness of the employed image filtering or restoration operators.}

A power regression model has been commonly used to explain the relationship between the fish length and the weight. In this work, Genetic Programming (GP) for symbolic regression is used to build a new model for predicting the fish weight, which allows us to include more features into the model to discover any hidden relationship, and the GP based symbolic regression makes the model interpretable comparing with other machine learning methods. A publicly available dataset is taken with four species of fish which includes more features than just the fish length that is commonly used in existing models. The proposed GP based symbolic regression method has been examined on those four species. The results are compared with the weight prediction baseline methods including Linear Regression, Power Regression model, k-Nearest Neighbour, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. GP performs better, or at least as good as the baseline methods on the test set. Furthermore, the generated GP models also can select different features for different species to improve the prediction performance due to GP's explicit feature selection ability. Some models are interpretable with relatively simple expression. The GP method is also able to find models that are similar to the power regression model, but more features are included rather than a single length feature to gain improved prediction performance.}

A power regression model is commonly used to explain the relationship between fish weight and length. However, this requires costly measurements of fish length. The present study applies machine learning techniques to predict fish weight from fish images, bypassing the length measurement step. In this study, we validate the feasibility of predicting fish weight from images directly. We use a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approach to predict fish weight from images by building regression models. The deep CNNs architecture VGG-11, ResNet-18 and DenseNet-121 are chosen to train the models. The fish images have different scales (length-pixel ratio) without including a ruler as a reference. The trained regressors of these three architectures reach R2 0.94, 0.95 and 0.96 on the test set. Our results support the feasibility of fish weight prediction with the CNNs model from images directly. The fish images look similar to humans, but CNNs regressors can detect the different fish weights. The CNNs regressors also can detect the fish images with different length-pixel ratios.}

  abstract={Classification and identification of marine plankton are important for marine ecological environment monitoring. Due to the tiny size of individual plankton and the weak light intensity in the marine environment, it is challenging for the imaging system to capture a clear image of plankton in the flowing water. Sometimes causing weak brightness and noise interference in the collected images. To this end, we propose an underwater image enhancement method based on local histogram equalization to remove noise while improving image clarity effectively. The proposed method improves the brightness and contrast in HSI color space, and preserves the color information (hue and saturation) in H and S channels. Experiments were carried out on the underwater plankton images. The enhancement performance of the proposed method was evaluated by commonly used metrics and compared with the well-known image enhancement methods, including a deep learning-based method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was superior to the other methods in noise reduction, structure similarity, and perceptual quality. This work presents a simple and effective method for underwater plankton image enhancement. The proposed enhancement method could provide high-quality images for implementing automatic plankton classification.},

During acoustic surveys, research vessels are equipped with echosounders that produce sound waves and then record all echoes coming from objects and targets in the water column. The preprocessing and scrutinizing of acoustic fish species data have always been manually conducted and have been considered time-consuming. Meanwhile, deep learning and machine learning-based approaches have also been adopted to automate or partially automate the acoustic echo scrutinizing process and build an objective process with which the species echo classification uncertainty is expected to be lower than the uncertainty of scrutinizing experts. A review of the state-of-the-art of different deep learning and machine learning applications in acoustic fish species echo classification has been highly requested. Therefore, the present paper is conceived to identify and scan the studies conducted on acoustic fish echo identification using deep learning and machine learning approaches. This document can be extended to include other marine organisms rather than just fish species. To search for related papers, we used a systematic approach to search the most known electronic databases over the last five years. We were able to identify 13 related works, which have been processed to give a summary of multiple deep and machine learning approaches used in acoustic fish species identification, and then compare their architectures, performances, and the challenges encountered in their applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study aimed to simulate cold chain interruption through freeze–thaw operations and evaluate the lipidomics data from salmon samples subjected to different numbers of freeze–thaw cycles by using rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) combined with an intelligent surgical knife (iKnife). The results indicated significant differences in the relative abundance of characteristic ions among the samples (p < 0.05). A total of 34 ions with variable importance for the projection values ≥1 were identified as potential biomarkers, including m/z 719.4233 ([PCC36:5–NH(CH3)3]−), m/z 337.3134 ([FAC22:1]−), m/z 720.4666 ([PEC35:6–H]−), m/z 309.2780 ([FAC20:1]−), m/z 777.4985 ([PCC40:4–NH(CH3)3]−), m/z 745.4421 ([PCC38:6–NH(CH3)3]−/[PEC38:6–NH3]−), m/z 747.4665 ([PCC38:5–NH(CH3)3]−/[PEC38:5–NH3]−), etc. The degree of lipid oxidation was found to be associated with the number of freeze–thaw cycles, exhibiting the most significant alterations in the relative abundance of lipid ions in the 8T samples. Additionally, sensory evaluation by the CIE-L*a*b* method and volatile analysis by headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography–mass spectrometry demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05) in color and odor among the salmon samples, with a correlation to the number of freeze–thaw cycles. The primary compounds responsible for alterations in salmon odor were aldehydes with lower odor thresholds. In summary, the iKnife-REIMS method accurately differentiated salmon muscle tissues based on varying levels of lipid oxidation, thus expanding the application of REIMS.}

Its shape varies and is versatile in posture, especially zooplankton. Plankton can be recognized from local or global perspectives. In this paper, we propose the Plankton Transformer Network (PlanktonTNet), which identifies plankton by extracting both local and global features. PlanktonTNet incorporates a Local Features Extraction Module (LFEM) and a Global Features Extraction Module (GFEM) to extract features using CNNs and the Swin Transformer, respectively. Additionally, a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) is employed to combine these features. Among CNN-based models, ResNet-34 achieved the best performance. PlanktonTNet, however, achieves a top-1 accuracy of 97.90% on the Kaggle7 test dataset, a 2.10% improvement over ResNet-34, and a top-1 accuracy of 97.00% on the ZooScanNet6 test dataset, showing a 1.04% gain over ResNet-34. Experimental results on the Kaggle7 and ZooScanNet6 datasets demonstrate that PlanktonTNet significantly outperforms existing methods.},

The monitoring approach will help to fill important knowledge gaps on target fish spatio-temporal distribution in hard-to-access areas, give valuable insight into target fish behavior, and help to identify the species' essential habitats, which is relevant for the design of marine protected areas in fish management and conservation. Many of the required hardware, such as underwater vehicles, sensors, and acoustic modems, have become very cost-effective over recent years, making this approach feasible.

  abstract = {Mussel farms are vital contributors to New Zealand’s booming aquaculture industry, driving economic growth and generating employment opportunities across the country. To meet the demand for sustainable mussel production, innovative computer vision and AI solutions are essential in detecting mussel floats that maintain crop line buoyancy. However, object detection in mussel farm images faces considerable challenges such as poor image quality, partial occlusion, and high variability in image conditions. In this paper, we propose a new genetic programming-based approach tailored for object detection in mussel farm images. The approach features a new waterline detection algorithm for image segmentation and a new genetic programming method, called 3-Tree GP, for object detection (mussel buoy/float). Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a detection F1 score of 94.4%, surpassing the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 by over 4%. In particular, the approach excels in identifying objects that are partially occluded, or located far away from the camera, making it suitable for real-world applications.}

An effective crop monitoring system that relies on high-resolution images from boat-mounted cameras requires an effective multi-object matching module. This paper presents a new Genetic Programming (GP)-based multi-object matching approach for mussel floats in farm images, addressing site-specific challenges such as a large number of tracklets, near-identical appearances, and low-overlapping scenes. Current object matching methods, including appearance models, motion models, and transformer models, struggle under these conditions. Evaluated on mussel farm images from the Marlborough Sounds of New Zealand, the proposed GP method demonstrates significantly higher matching accuracy, achieving 96.4% compared to 39.6% by a state-of-the-art transformer model. Our GP method achieves accurate multi-object matching in both slow and fast-moving scenarios, outperforming the state-of-the-art particularly in the latter.}

  abstract = {Mussel farming is a thriving industry in New Zealand and is crucial to local communities. Currently, farmers keep track of their mussel floats by taking regular boat trips to the farm. This is a labour-intensive assignment. Integrating computer vision techniques into aquafarms will significantly alleviate the pressure on mussel farmers. However, tracking a large number of identical targets under various image conditions raises a considerable challenge. This paper proposes a new computer vision-based pipeline to automatically detect and track mussel floats in images. The proposed pipeline consists of three steps, i.e. float detection, float description, and float matching. In the first step, a new detector based on several image processing operators is used to detect mussel floats of all sizes in the images. Then a new descriptor is employed to provide unique identity markers to mussel floats based on the relative positions of their neighbours. Finally, float matching across adjacent frames is done by image registration. Experimental results on the images taken in Marlborough Sounds New Zealand have shown that the proposed pipeline achieves an 82.9% MOTA – 18% higher than current deep learning-based approaches – without the need for training.}

	abstract = {Underwater fish recognition is an important task in fish stock assessment and marine ecosystem studies. Machine learning techniques have been applied to train high-performance fish recognition models from underwater images. However, underwater images often contain extremely noisy backgrounds, hindering the training of accurate recognition models. Traditional methods exploit handcrafted features to train traditional classifiers. These methods often suffer from low recognition accuracy and limited scalability to large-scale datasets. While deep learning approaches have been proposed, the challenge of learning with noisy underwater images has not yet been fully addressed. We propose a discriminative feature learning (DFL) framework to train accurate fish recognition models on noisy underwater images. By leveraging the idea of contrastive learning, DFL encourages the model to learn more discriminative features for images in different classes and similar features for images in the same class. To better address the noisy background problem, DFL also utilizes a regularization technique called attention suppression to prevent the model from paying too much attention to the noisy background. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of DFL over the current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the noisy nature of underwater images makes it difficult to train high-performance fish recognition models. This work presents a novel deep adversarial learning framework called AdvFish to train accurate deep neural networks fish recognition models from noisy large-scale underwater images. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature engineering or implicit machine learning techniques to mitigate the noise, AdvFish is a min–max bilevel adversarial optimization framework that trains the model on adversarially perturbed images via a proposed adaptive perturbation method. We show, on multiple benchmark datasets, that AdvFish holds a clear advantage over existing methods/models, especially on a noisy large-scale dataset.

	abstract = {In industrial aquaculture, accurately counting fish in real-time is crucial for optimizing feeding strategies, preventing disease, and managing water quality. Current methods utilizing sensors, acoustics, machine learning, and density map regression face challenges such as high costs, invasiveness, and computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose the YOLOv8n-MEMAGD method for accurate real-time fish counting. This method enhances YOLOv8 by incorporating the GELU activation function, MPDIoU for localization loss, and the C2f-FAM and C2f-MSCA modules into the backbone network. Additionally, the neck network is redesigned with a gather-and-distribution mechanism. Experimental results under land-based industrial aquaculture conditions demonstrate that YOLOv8n-MEMAGD achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.28 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.84, even in challenging conditions such as fish overlap, aggregation, and background confounding. Compared to YOLOv8n, the proposed method increased average precision (AP50) for fish detection by 6.2 %, and significantly reduced MAE and RMSE by 61.4 % and 65.2 %, respectively, compared to CSRNet. Additionally, the method achieved a frame rate of 61 frames per second (FPS) when the number of fish ranged from 79 to 91, representing a 390.4 % increase over CSRNet. By comparing heatmaps, the proposed method demonstrates more effective detection of fish edge contours than current advanced algorithms. In conclusion, the proposed method shows promise for application in aquacultural scenarios with higher turbidity and larger number of fish. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In biomass estimation based on size-related features, regression models are commonly used to predict fish mass. However, in real-world scenarios, fish are often partially occluded by others, resulting in missing or corrupted features. To address this issue, we propose a robust framework that integrates feature imputation with regression. Missing features are first reconstructed through imputation, followed by regression for biomass prediction. We evaluated various imputation and regression methods and found that the autoencoder achieved the best performance in imputation. Among regression models, SVR, Extra Trees, and MLP performed best in their respective categories. These three models, combined with the autoencoder, were selected to construct the final framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves performance. For instance, the RMSE of SVR, Extra Trees, and MLP decreased from 21.10 g, 2.49 g, and 18.40 g to 6.53 g, 1.95 g, and 5.09 g, respectively.}

Fish health is a priority for the industry, and the change in the health status of king salmon needs to be accurately detected at the earliest possible stage. Many factors affect the health of king salmon, such as temperature. Identifying the key features that influence health prediction is a crucial step toward achieving this goal. This study utilizes trial data collected by the Cawthron Institute, which includes diverse information on king salmon, such as blood biochemistry and hematology. We explore the data by employing statistical methods and feature selection techniques in machine learning to identify the most relevant features for king salmon health prediction, aiming to classify individuals as healthy or unhealthy with a small number of features. The results show that although the most efficient feature selection techniques on different datasets vary, overall, feature selection approaches can successfully identify relevant and informative features for king salmon health classification. Through the incorporation of a few selected features, the learned classifiers could still achieve statistically equal or better classification performance. This study not only contributes to the understanding of the health indicators of king salmon but also provides crucial insights into health prediction, which will be beneficial to the improvement of the health of king salmon, leading to the development of more effective management strategies for aquaculture.}

Evolutionary machine learning algorithms have shown their superiority in learning models for challenging tasks. However, they have not been investigated for health prediction in king salmon farming. This paper focuses on data processing and machine learning algorithm design to develop king salmon health prediction models in Aotearoa New Zealand. Particularly, this paper proposes a king salmon health prediction method based on genetic programming which is an evolutionary machine learning algorithm. The results show that genetic programming achieves the best overall performance among all examined typical machine learning algorithms for most trials. Further analyses show that genetic programming can automatically detect important features for learning classifiers for king salmon health classification tasks effectively, and can also learn potentially interpretable models.

  abstract = {The expanding mussel farming industry, especially in regions like New Zealand (NZ), necessitates advanced monitoring and management solutions for sustainable and efficient operations. Currently, manual labor and on-site operations limit real-time capabilities and overall efficiency. To address these challenges, large-scale 3D reconstruction offers a viable solution, enabling reproducible representations of mussel farm scenes based on captured video for off-site evaluation and precise decision-making. Conventional 3D reconstruction methods often require intricate manual camera calibration, posing challenges for real-world applications, particularly in marine scenarios. In contrast, this paper presents an innovative and practical approach for large-scale mussel farm reconstruction by integrating GPS auxiliary data without heavy camera calibration. The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive large-scale 3D visualization of mussel farms using video footage and simultaneous GPS information captured by a vessel-mounted camera. Our methodology involves a two-step process: First, making adaptive image sampling from captured video and applying Structure from Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation and a dense 3D reconstruction, accurately reproducing local 3D scenes of partial mussel farms. Then, GPS data will be integrated for georeferencing and localization. This alignment empowers farm managers with geospatial accuracy for decision-making, resource allocation, and strategic planning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on reconstruction accuracy and completeness, and GPS geo-registration precision, highlighting its potential for advancing mussel farm monitoring.}

  abstract = {Mussel farming in New Zealand (NZ) is a thriving and crucial industry that supports local communities and underscores aquaculture’s significance. A key task in mussel farming involves buoy inspection to monitor mussel growth for efficient harvesting. Currently, this process heavily relies on manual labor, resulting in labor and time-intensive spot operations for farmers. To address this, AI methods have recently been studied for fully automated buoy detection from captured images, showing promising results. However, these methods have mainly focused on images with good illumination, limiting their applicability in low-light conditions, such as dawn and dusk. This paper presents the first exploration of AI-based automated buoy detection in low-light environments, taking steps toward full-day buoy inspection. We investigate the impact of low-light conditions on deep learning-based buoy detection performance and explore techniques like intrinsic decomposition and low-light image enhancement to mitigate these effects. Incorporating these analyzed and enhanced results into a YOLO-based deep learning model results in significant improvements in low-light detections.}

  abstract = {As the mussel farming industry expands, particularly in regions such as New Zealand, there is a growing need for advanced monitoring and management solutions to ensure sustainability and operational efficiency. The current reliance on manual infrequent observation of aquaculture structures limits farmers' ability to monitor them in real time. Addressing these challenges, large-scale 3D reconstruction provides a practical solution by facilitating the creation of replicable depictions of mussel farm scenes and floatation buoys derived from recorded video, supporting off-site evaluation and enabling precise decision making. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the visualisation and monitoring of mussel farm floatation through a hierarchical reconstruction process. In contrast to earlier studies, we focus on recovering not only the overall environment (background) but also the finer details of key elements such as buoys to create a comprehensive representation of mussel farm geometry and appearance. We propose to segment the scene into the background and granular object instances and reconstruct them separately in a multi-stage process. The initial 3D scene reconstruction is performed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique, leveraging video footage captured by a vessel-mounted camera. This coarse reconstruction serves as the foundation for subsequent fine-grained enhancements. To recover finer details, object tracking is applied and the trajectories obtained are then conjunct with geometry triangulation to determine the real-world positions of individual buoys. A multiple-scale denoising method, grounded in dominant direction correlation, is implemented to eliminate non-reliable tracking objects and reduce reconstruction artifacts, ensuring the accuracy of the final results. This hierarchical reconstruction approach contributes to the advancement of mussel farm management by offering a powerful technology for comprehensive visualisation, enabling farmers to make informed decisions based on a detailed understanding of the mussel farm's geometry and dynamics.}

Given the low-visibility nature of most aquatic environments, traditional observational methods face significant limitations in uncovering the potential ecological impacts of marine debris. This study proposes an integrated monitoring framework that combines high-resolution acoustic imaging technology and machine learning algorithms to investigate the ecological effects of debris on fish behavior. Specifically, acoustic visual data on debris distribution and fish behavior are collected using a single acoustic camera. Machine learning algorithms are then employed to enhance the monitoring capability of the framework to distinguish between fish and debris targets. Finally, the optical flow technique was applied to visualize fish behavior trajectories around the debris. The approach was validated through water tank experiments and field tests, demonstrating its feasibility and robustness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a successful study employing CNNs to analyze the biochemical composition of fish based on a very small Raman spectroscopic dataset. Our approach combines a tailored CNN architecture with the comprehensive data preparation procedure, effectively mitigating the challenges posed by extreme data scarcity. The results demonstrate that our CNN can significantly outperform two state-of-the-art CNN models and multiple traditional machine learning models, paving the way for accurate and automated analysis of fish biochemical composition.}

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of biochemical compositions in fish products is essential for quality control in the seafood industry and nutritional research. While spectroscopic techniques enable non-destructive analysis, each method has limitations in prediction accuracy and reliability. Multi-modal data fusion offers a promising solution, but developing robust fusion strategies remains challenging due to complex relationships between spectral features and biochemical properties. This paper presents GP-Fusion, a genetic programming-based high-level fusion method that integrates multiple spectroscopic modalities. Unlike conventional approaches, GPFusion evolves interpretable fusion functions to optimize predictions from diverse spectroscopy work-flows. A key innovation is the replicate variance penalty, which enhances prediction consistency across replicate measurements by capturing within-sample variability and mitigating batch effects. Experimental evaluations on three biochemical targets, including Omega-3, Omega-6, and monounsaturated fatty acids, show that GPFusion improves the coefficient of determination by 6.9%, 8.0%, and 2.6%, respectively. Compared with other high-level fusion strategies, GPFusion delivers more stable predictions with lower variance while maintaining competitive accuracy. Additional empirical studies confirms the effectiveness of the replicate variance penalty and reveal critical trade-offs between tree depth and terminal flexibility for evolving compact and interpretable fusion functions.}
